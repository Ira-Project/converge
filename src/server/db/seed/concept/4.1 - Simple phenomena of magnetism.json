    "chapter_text": "**I. Fundamental Properties of Magnets**\n*   All magnets possess two poles: a North (N) pole and a South (S) pole.\n*   **Law of Magnetic Poles:** Like poles repel (N-N, S-S), while unlike poles attract (N-S).\n*   The magnetic force between poles diminishes as their separation increases.\n*   When freely suspended, the N pole of a magnet consistently points towards the Earth's geographical north, enabling its use as a compass.\n\n**II. Magnetic Materials**\n*   **Magnetic (Ferromagnetic) Materials:** These materials (e.g., iron, steel, nickel, cobalt) are attracted by magnets and can be magnetised, either temporarily or permanently.\n*   **Non-Magnetic Materials:** These materials (e.g., aluminium, wood) are neither attracted by magnets nor can they be magnetised.\n*   **Magnetic Poles:** These are the regions on a magnet, typically near its ends, to which magnetic materials are most strongly attracted. They always occur in pairs of equal strength.\n\n**III. Induced Magnetism**\n*   An unmagnetised magnetic material becomes magnetised when it touches or is brought close to a pole of a permanent magnet.\n*   When induced, the end of the material closest to the inducing pole acquires the opposite polarity, and the far end acquires the same polarity.\n\n**IV. Magnetisation and Demagnetisation**\n*   **Temporary Magnets:** Made from soft magnetic materials (e.g., soft iron), these magnetise easily but also lose their magnetism readily.\n*   **Permanent Magnets:** Made from hard magnetic materials (e.g., steel), these are harder to magnetise but retain their magnetism for a long time.\n*   **Methods of Magnetisation:**\n    *   Placing a ferromagnetic material inside a solenoid and gradually increasing a direct current (d.c.) through the coil.\n    *   Hammering a magnetic material while it is within a magnetic field.\n    *   Stroking a magnetic material repeatedly in the same direction with one pole of a magnet.\n*   **Methods of Demagnetisation:**\n    *   Placing a magnet inside a solenoid and passing an alternating current (a.c.) through it, which is then gradually reduced.\n    *   Dropping or heating a magnet.\n    *   Hammering a magnetic material in the absence of a magnetic field.\n\n**V. Magnetic Fields**\n*   **Definition:** A magnetic field is the region of space surrounding a magnet where a magnetic force can be detected.\n*   **Representation:** Magnetic fields are represented by lines of force, or field lines.\n*   **Direction:** The direction of a magnetic field at any point is defined as the direction of the force that would be exerted on a hypothetical isolated N pole placed at that point. Arrows on field lines point away from N poles and towards S poles.\n*   **Strength:** The strength of a magnetic field is indicated by the density of the field lines; regions with closer field lines signify a stronger field, while widely spaced lines indicate a weaker field.\n*   Magnetic forces arise from the interaction of magnetic fields.\n*   **Plotting Magnetic Fields:**\n    *   **Plotting Compass Method:** A small pivoted compass needle is used to trace the path of field lines by aligning its poles and marking points.\n    *   **Iron Filings Method:** Iron filings sprinkled onto a sheet of paper over a magnet align themselves along the field lines when the paper is gently tapped.\n*   **Neutral Point:** A specific point within a combined magnetic field (typically between like poles) where the magnetic fields from opposing magnets cancel each other out, resulting in zero net magnetic field and no field lines.\n\n**VI. Electromagnets**\n*   **Construction:** An electromagnet consists of a coil of wire wound around a soft iron core, which becomes magnetised when an electrical current passes through the coil.\n*   **Properties:** Electromagnets are temporary magnets whose strength can be varied by changing the current, and their magnetism can be switched on or off.\n*   **Factors Affecting Strength:** The strength of an electromagnet increases if:\n    *   The current flowing through the coil increases.\n    *   The number of turns in the coil increases.\n    *   The poles of the core are moved closer together (e.g., in C-core or horseshoe electromagnets).\n\n**VII. Uses of Magnets**\n*   **Permanent Magnets:** Used in applications requiring a constant magnetic field without continuous power input. Examples include compasses, computer hard disks, electric motors, electricity generators, microphones, loudspeakers, and credit/debit cards.\n*   **Electromagnets:** Employed where variable, temporary, or switchable magnetic fields are needed. Examples include cranes for lifting heavy iron objects, electric bells, magnetic locks, relays, and as components in motors and generators.\n*   **Magnetic Shielding:** Ferromagnetic materials (e.g., steel, mu-metal) are used for magnetic screening to protect sensitive electronic equipment from external magnetic fields.\n\n**VIII. Earth's Magnetic Field**\n*   The Earth possesses a vast magnetic field, which, in a horizontal plane, can be approximated by parallel straight lines running from the geographical south to the geographical north.\n*   **Declination:** The Earth's magnetic north pole does not perfectly coincide with its geographical north pole, resulting in an angle of declination between magnetic north and true north at most locations.",
