On Earth, the gravitational field strength is approximately $!$9.8\\ \\text{N/kg}$!$. The scientist emphasizes that while their mass is a constant measure of their body's matter, the 'weight' they feel is directly related to the local gravitational field strength, which is equivalent to the acceleration of free fall. What is the athlete's mass in grams?",
