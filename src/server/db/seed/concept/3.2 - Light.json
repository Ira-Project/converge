    "chapter_text": "Here are the key concepts from Section 3.2 - Light:\n\n### 3.2.1 Reflection of light\n\n*   **Sources of Light:**\n    *   **Luminous sources:** Objects that make their own light (e.g., Sun, lamps, candles). Atoms become 'excited' and emit light.\n    *   **Non-luminous objects:** Objects that reflect light from luminous sources, making them visible (e.g., this page, Moon).\n*   **Rays and Beams:**\n    *   **Ray:** The direction of light's path, represented by a straight line with an arrow.\n    *   **Beam:** A stream of light, which can be:\n        *   **Parallel:** Rays travel parallel to each other.\n        *   **Diverging:** Rays spread out.\n        *   **Converging:** Rays get narrower, coming to a point.\n*   **Pinhole Camera:** Forms an image by allowing light through a small hole. Images are real, inverted, and can be smaller/larger depending on distance.\n*   **Shadows:** Formed by opaque objects blocking light.\n    *   **Umbra:** The central, completely dark region of a shadow (from a point source or the darkest part from an extended source).\n    *   **Penumbra:** A region of partial shadow where some light reaches (from an extended source).\n*   **Reflection of Light (Plane Mirrors):**\n    *   **Normal:** A line perpendicular to the mirror surface at the point where the incident ray strikes.\n    *   **Angle of incidence ($i$):** The angle between the incident ray and the normal.\n    *   **Angle of reflection ($r$):** The angle between the reflected ray and the normal.\n    *   **Law of reflection:**\n        *   The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection: $i = r$.\n        *   The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal all lie in the same plane.\n    *   **Regular reflection:** Occurs when light reflects from a smooth surface (e.g., plane mirror), reflecting a parallel beam as a parallel beam.\n    *   **Diffuse reflection:** Occurs when light reflects from a rough surface, reflecting rays in many directions.\n*   **Properties of Image in a Plane Mirror:**\n    *   **Virtual:** Cannot be formed on a screen; produced by rays that seem to come from it but do not actually pass through it.\n    *   As far behind the mirror as the object is in front, with the line joining corresponding points on object and image being perpendicular to the mirror.\n    *   Same size as the object.\n    *   **Laterally inverted:** Left and right are interchanged.\n    *   Orientation depends on object's alignment: same orientation if parallel to mirror, $180^\\circ$ relative if parallel to normal.\n*   **Periscope:** Uses two parallel plane mirrors fixed at $45^\\circ$ to turn light through $90^\\circ$ at each reflection, allowing observation over obstacles.\n\n### 3.2.2 Refraction of light\n\n*   **Refraction:** The bending of light when it passes from one transparent medium to another due to a change in speed.\n    *   **Angle of refraction ($r$):** The angle between the refracted ray and the normal to the surface.\n*   **Facts about Refraction:**\n    *   Light bends *towards* the normal when entering an optically denser medium (e.g., air to glass).\n    *   Light bends *away* from the normal when entering an optically less dense medium (e.g., glass to air).\n    *   A ray traveling along the normal is not refracted.\n    *   A ray emerging from a parallel-sided block is parallel to the entering ray but displaced sideways.\n*   **Real and Apparent Depth:** Refraction causes objects submerged in water to appear shallower than their real depth.\n*   **Refractive Index ($n$):**\n    *   **Definition:** The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (or air) to its speed in the medium.\n        $$n = \\frac{\\text{speed of light in air (or a vacuum)}}{\\text{speed of light in medium}}$$\n    *   It is also related to the angles of incidence and refraction (Snell's Law):\n        $$n = \\frac{\\sin i}{\\sin r}$$\n    *   A higher refractive index means light slows down more and bends more.\n*   **Critical Angle ($c$):**\n    *   **Definition:** The angle of incidence in an optically denser medium for which the angle of refraction in the less dense medium is $90^\\circ$. The refracted ray passes along the boundary.\n    *   Relationship with refractive index:\n        $$n = \\frac{1}{\\sin c}$$\n*   **Total Internal Reflection (TIR):** When the angle of incidence in the denser medium is greater than the critical angle, all incident light is reflected back into the denser medium.\n*   **Totally Reflecting Prisms:** Use TIR (e.g., $45^\\circ$ right-angled glass prisms) to turn light through $90^\\circ$ or $180^\\circ$, overcoming mirror defects. Used in periscopes and binoculars.\n*   **Light Pipes and Optical Fibres:** Use total internal reflection to 'trap' and guide light along curved paths.\n    *   **Uses:** Endoscopes (medical imaging), telecommunication (high-speed data transmission).\n    *   **Advantages over copper cables:** Higher data rate, more secure (unaffected by electronic interference), lower power loss over long distances, lighter, thinner, cheaper, easier to handle/install.\n    *   **Disadvantage:** Less robust, can break if bent too much.\n\n### 3.2.3 Thin lenses\n\n*   **Types of Lenses:**\n    *   **Converging (convex) lens:** Thicker in the middle, bends light inwards, brings parallel rays to a real focus. Used as a magnifying glass.\n    *   **Diverging (concave) lens:** Thinner in the middle, spreads light out, forms a diminished virtual image.\n*   **Lens Terminology:**\n    *   **Optical centre (C):** The central point of the lens.\n    *   **Principal axis:** The line passing through the optical centre at right angles to the lens.\n    *   **Principal focus (F) / Focal point:** For a converging lens, the point on the principal axis where parallel rays converge after refraction. For a diverging lens, the point from which refracted parallel rays appear to diverge.\n    *   **Focal length ($f$):** The distance between the optical centre (C) and the principal focus (F). A shorter focal length means a more powerful lens.\n*   **Image Formation by a Converging Lens:** The characteristics (real/virtual, enlarged/diminished, upright/inverted) depend on the object's position relative to F and 2F.\n    *   **Real image:** Can be formed on a screen; rays actually pass through it.\n    *   **Virtual image:** Cannot be formed on a screen; rays appear to come from it but do not actually pass through.\n*   **Ray Diagrams for Lenses:** Uses specific rays to locate images:\n    *   A ray parallel to the principal axis refracts through F.\n    *   A ray through the optical centre C is undeviated.\n    *   A ray through F refracts parallel to the principal axis.\n*   **Magnification ($M$):** The ratio of image size to object size, or image distance to object distance.\n    $$M = \\frac{\\text{image size}}{\\text{object size}} = \\frac{\\text{distance of image from lens}}{\\text{distance of object from lens}}$$\n*   **Power of a Lens ($P$):** A measure of how much a lens converges or diverges light.\n    $$P = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n    where $f$ is the focal length in metres.\n*   **Magnifying Glass:** A converging lens used to produce an enlarged, upright, virtual image of a close object (object placed between F and C).\n*   **Spectacles:** Lenses used to correct vision defects:\n    *   **Short-sight (myopia):** Image forms in front of the retina. Corrected by a **diverging lens**.\n    *   **Long-sight (hyperopia):** Image forms behind the retina. Corrected by a **converging lens**.\n\n### 3.2.4 Dispersion of light\n\n*   **Refraction by a Prism:** Light bends upon entering and exiting a prism. The overall change in direction is called **deviation**. Unlike parallel-sided blocks, the emergent ray is not parallel to the incident ray.\n*   **Dispersion:** The separation of white light into its constituent colours (a **spectrum**) when it passes through a medium like a prism.\n    *   Occurs because the refractive index of the medium is different for different colours (wavelengths/frequencies).\n    *   Violet light has the shortest wavelength, highest frequency, and is refracted most.\n    *   Red light has the longest wavelength, lowest frequency, and is refracted least.\n    *   The traditional order of colours in the visible spectrum (increasing wavelength): Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red.\n*   **Monochromatic Light:** Light of one colour and therefore of one frequency.",
