    "chapter_text": "### 4.3.1 Circuit diagrams and components\n*   Circuit diagrams use conventional symbols to represent various electrical components.\n*   Common components include cells, batteries, lamps, resistors, ammeters, voltmeters, thermistors, light-dependent resistors (LDRs), relays, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and semiconductor diodes.\n\n### 4.3.2 Series and parallel circuits\n\n**Current and Potential Difference**\n*   **Series Circuit:**\n    *   Current is the same at every point in the circuit.\n    *   The total potential difference (p.d.) across components is the sum of the individual p.d.s across each component:\n        $V = V_1 + V_2 + V_3$\n*   **Parallel Circuit:**\n    *   Components are connected side by side, allowing current to split into alternative paths and then recombine.\n    *   The current from the source is larger than the current in each branch.\n    *   The p.d. across devices connected in parallel is equal.\n*   **Current at a Junction:**\n    *   The sum of the currents into a junction equals the sum of the currents out of the junction.\n\n**Cells, Batteries, and Electromotive Force (e.m.f.)**\n*   A battery consists of two or more electric cells.\n*   For cells joined in series (positive terminal of one to negative of the next), their e.m.f.s add together to give the combined e.m.f.\n*   For cells connected in parallel, the e.m.f. at the terminals remains the same, but the battery lasts longer.\n*   The p.d. at the terminals of a battery decreases slightly when current is drawn due to internal resistance.\n*   When no current is drawn (open circuit), the terminal p.d. is maximum and equals the e.m.f. of the battery.\n*   Potential difference (or e.m.f.) is defined as the work done ($W$) per unit charge ($Q$):\n    $V = \\frac{W}{Q}$\n\n**Resistance**\n*   **Resistors in Series:**\n    *   The same current flows through each resistor.\n    *   The total voltage across all resistors is the sum of the separate voltages across them:\n        $V = V_1 + V_2 + V_3$\n    *   The combined (total) resistance ($R$) is the sum of individual resistances:\n        $R = R_1 + R_2 + R_3$\n*   **Resistors in Parallel:**\n    *   The voltage across the ends of each resistor is the same.\n    *   The total current ($I$) equals the sum of the currents in the separate branches:\n        $I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3$\n    *   The combined resistance ($R$) is given by:\n        $\\frac{1}{R} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\frac{1}{R_3}$\n    *   For two resistors in parallel, the combined resistance can be calculated as:\n        $R = \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$ (product over sum)\n    *   The combined resistance of two resistors in parallel is less than that of either resistor alone.\n\n**Advantages of Parallel Circuits (e.g., Lighting)**\n*   The p.d. across each lamp is fixed at the supply p.d., ensuring consistent brightness.\n*   Each lamp can be turned on and off independently.\n*   If one lamp fails, the others can still operate.\n\n### 4.3.3 Action and use of circuit components\n\n**Resistance and Potential Dividers**\n*   **Increase in Resistance of a Conductor:**\n    *   In metals, resistance increases with temperature because atoms vibrate faster, hindering electron flow.\n    *   For a constant current, if resistance ($R$) increases, the potential difference ($V$) across the conductor increases (from Ohm's Law $V=IR$).\n*   **Variable Potential Divider:**\n    *   A circuit arrangement that divides the supply voltage into a smaller output voltage.\n    *   The current ($I$) in a series potential divider with total voltage $V$ and resistors $R_1, R_2$ is:\n        $I = \\frac{V}{(R_1 + R_2)}$\n    *   The voltage across resistor $R_1$ ($V_1$) is:\n        $V_1 = V \\frac{R_1}{(R_1 + R_2)}$\n    *   The voltage across resistor $R_2$ ($V_2$) is:\n        $V_2 = V \\frac{R_2}{(R_1 + R_2)}$\n    *   The ratio of voltages across resistors is equal to the ratio of their resistances:\n        $\\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{R_1}{R_2}$\n    *   Moving the contact on a variable resistor changes the output p.d.\n\n**Specific Components**\n*   **Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR):**\n    *   A semiconductor device whose resistance decreases as the intensity of light falling on it increases.\n    *   Used in applications like photographic exposure meters and light-operated alarms.\n*   **Thermistor (Negative Temperature Coefficient - NTC):**\n    *   A semiconductor device whose resistance decreases significantly as its temperature rises.\n    *   Used for temperature measurement and in switching circuits (e.g., temperature alarms).\n*   **Relays:**\n    *   An electromagnetic switch that allows a small current in a control circuit to operate a larger current in another circuit.\n    *   Provides electrical isolation between the control circuit and the switched appliance (e.g., mains supply).\n*   **Light-Emitting Diode (LED):**\n    *   A semiconductor diode that emits light when forward-biased.\n    *   **Forward-biased:** Current flows, cathode (C) connected to negative, anode (A) to positive.\n    *   **Reverse-biased:** No current flows; can be damaged if reverse bias voltage is too high.\n    *   Requires a series resistor to limit current.\n    *   Applications: Indicator lamps, numerical displays, diode lasers.\n*   **Semiconductor Diode:**\n    *   A non-ohmic conductor that allows current to pass in one direction only.\n    *   **Forward-biased:** Anode connected to positive, cathode to negative; resistance is small, current flows.\n    *   **Reverse-biased:** Connections are reversed; resistance is large, no current flows.\n    *   Primary application: Rectifier (converts alternating current to direct current).",
