    "chapter_text": "### 6.2.1 The Sun as a Star\n\n*   **The Sun**: A medium-sized star primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It emits radiant energy, mainly in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions, from glowing hydrogen.\n*   **Nuclear Reactions in Stars**:\n    *   Stars are powered by nuclear fusion, where hydrogen is converted into helium in their core.\n    *   The high temperature in the core, necessary for fusion, is maintained by the energy released during this process.\n    *   Stars vary in properties like age, size, mass, surface temperature, color, and brightness. Hotter, brighter stars (white/blue) have surface temperatures of 6000\u201325000\u00b0C, while cooler stars (red/yellow) are 3000\u20136000\u00b0C.\n\n### 6.2.2 Stars\n\n*   **Light-years**: A unit used to measure astronomical distances, defined as the distance light travels in the vacuum of space in one year.\n    *   Formula: $1 \\text{ light-year} = 9.5 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ km} = 9.5 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ m}$\n*   **Galaxies**: Large collections of billions of stars, along with clouds of gas (mainly hydrogen) and dust. Our Solar System is part of the Milky Way, a spiral galaxy.\n*   **Origin of Stars**:\n    *   Stars form from interstellar clouds of dust and gas collapsing under gravitational attraction, forming a protostar.\n    *   As the protostar contracts, gravitational potential energy converts to kinetic energy, increasing the core temperature.\n    *   Nuclear fusion begins when the core is hot enough, converting hydrogen to helium, and a star is born. Massive young stars become blue/white; smaller mass stars (like the Sun) become yellow/red dwarfs.\n*   **Life Cycle of Stars**:\n    *   **Stable Star**: In a stable star (e.g., our Sun), the inward gravitational force is balanced by the outward thermal pressure from the high core temperature.\n    *   **Low Mass Stars (like the Sun)**:\n        *   **Red Giant**: When hydrogen fuel runs out, the core collapses, heating up, and outer layers expand and cool. Helium to carbon fusion begins.\n        *   **Planetary Nebula**: After helium is consumed, the red giant's core collapses, expelling outer layers as a glowing shell of ionized gas.\n        *   **White Dwarf**: The small, dense core remnant of a low-mass star, which eventually cools.\n        *   **Black Dwarf**: A theoretical final stage where a white dwarf has cooled completely, consisting mainly of carbon.\n    *   **High Mass Stars**:\n        *   **Red Supergiant**: After hydrogen, these stars' cores collapse, leading to helium to carbon fusion, and further fusion into heavier elements up to iron.\n        *   **Supernova**: When fusion stops, the star releases immense energy in a violent explosion, creating elements heavier than iron and scattering material into space.\n        *   **Neutron Star**: A very dense remnant of a supernova, spinning rapidly and emitting radio waves (pulsar).\n        *   **Black Hole**: If the red supergiant is extremely massive, the supernova remnant collapses further into a region where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.\n\n### 6.2.3 The Universe\n\n*   **The Universe**: Composed of billions of galaxies, with the Milky Way being one.\n*   **Expanding Universe / Redshift**:\n    *   Light emitted from stars in distant galaxies appears \"redshifted\" (shifted to longer wavelengths) compared to light on Earth.\n    *   The greater the distance of a galaxy, the greater its redshift, indicating it is moving away from Earth faster.\n    *   This phenomenon is explained by the Doppler effect for light and provides evidence that the Universe is expanding.\n*   **The Big Bang Theory**: Proposes that the Universe originated approximately 14 billion years ago from an extremely dense state in a massive explosion, followed by continuous expansion.\n*   **Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR)**:\n    *   Radiation leftover from the Big Bang, pervading all space.\n    *   It has been redshifted into the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum as the Universe expanded.\n    *   CMBR provides strong evidence supporting the Big Bang Theory.\n*   **Hubble's Law**: Relates the speed of recession ($v$) of a distant galaxy to its distance ($d$).\n    *   Formula: $v = H_0 d$\n    *   **Hubble Constant ($H_0$)**: The ratio of the speed of recession to distance ($H_0 = \\frac{v}{d}$). Its estimated value is approximately $2.2 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n*   **Age of the Universe**: Can be estimated as the inverse of the Hubble constant, assuming a constant rate of expansion since the Big Bang.\n    *   Formula: $\\text{Age} = \\frac{1}{H_0}$\n    *   Estimated age: $\\approx 14 \\text{ billion years}$.",
