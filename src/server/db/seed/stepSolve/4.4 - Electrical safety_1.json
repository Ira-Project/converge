The worker mistakenly uses an extension lead fitted with a $!$3\\,A$!$ fuse, which blows instantly upon plugging in the printer. Realizing the mistake, they attempt to plug the printer directly into another wall socket on the same ring main. However, this time, the entire circuit trips, as the circuit breaker rated at $!$32\\,A$!$ has activated. Given that the computers and monitors already connected to the circuit draw a combined current of $!$10\\,A$!$, determine the total current flowing through the circuit breaker when the printer and the existing computers/monitors are all operational on this circuit.",
