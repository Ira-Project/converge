They are considering using either heavy water ($!$D_2O$!$) or graphite as the moderator. Heavy water increases the cost by $!$20\\%$!$ but improves neutron moderation by $!$15\\%$!$, while graphite is cheaper but less effective. If the reactor requires a minimum neutron moderation level of $!$80\\%$!$ to sustain the chain reaction, and graphite alone provides $!$65\\%$!$ moderation, by what percentage must the reactor's core volume be increased if graphite is chosen over heavy water, assuming moderation is directly proportional to volume?",
