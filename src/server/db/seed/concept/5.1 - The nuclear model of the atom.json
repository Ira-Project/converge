    "chapter_text": "### The Atom: Early Models and Modern Structure\n*   **Early \"Plum-Pudding\" Model:** Regarded the atom as a positively charged sphere with negatively charged electrons distributed throughout it.\n*   **Modern Nuclear Model:**\n    *   Consists of a small, dense, positively charged **nucleus** at its center.\n    *   Negatively charged **electrons** orbit the nucleus in a surrounding cloud.\n    *   In a neutral atom, the total negative charge of the electrons is equal and opposite to the total positive charge of the nucleus.\n\n### Experimental Evidence: Geiger and Marsden's Scattering\n*   **Experiment:** Alpha ($\\alpha$-) particles were directed at a thin metal foil (e.g., gold).\n*   **Observations:**\n    *   Most $\\alpha$-particles passed straight through the foil undeflected.\n    *   Some $\\alpha$-particles were scattered (deflected) through appreciable angles.\n    *   A very small number (about 1 in 8000) were deflected by more than 90$^\\circ$ (appeared to \"bounce back\").\n*   **Rutherford's Conclusions (Supporting the Nuclear Model):**\n    *   The atom is mostly empty space.\n    *   Almost all of the atom's mass and all of its positive charge are concentrated in a tiny, dense nucleus.\n    *   The observed deflections were due to the strong electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged $\\alpha$-particles and the positively charged nucleus.\n\n### Ions\n*   **Neutral Atom:** An atom with no net electrical charge, meaning the number of protons equals the number of electrons.\n*   **Positive Ion:** Formed when a neutral atom loses one or more negatively charged electrons, resulting in a net positive charge.\n*   **Negative Ion:** Formed when a neutral atom gains one or more extra negatively charged electrons, resulting in a net negative charge.\n\n### Atomic Models: Bohr and Schr\u00f6dinger\n*   **Rutherford-Bohr Model:**\n    *   Suggested that electrons orbit the nucleus in specific, discrete energy levels (orbits).\n    *   **Excitation:** When an atom gains energy (e.g., by heating), electrons can jump to higher energy orbits.\n    *   **De-excitation:** When electrons fall back to lower energy orbits, they emit a photon of electromagnetic radiation. The energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy difference between the two orbits: $E_{photon} = E_{higher} - E_{lower}$.\n    *   **Ionisation Energy:** The minimum energy required for an electron to completely escape the atom, resulting in the formation of an ion.\n*   **Schr\u00f6dinger Model:**\n    *   Replaced the idea of definite orbits with \"hazy electron clouds,\" representing regions where electrons are most likely to be found.\n    *   Maintained the concept of discrete energy levels, which are unique to each element.\n    *   **Line Spectra:** Produced when excited atoms emit photons with specific energies, resulting in discrete colored lines unique to each element.\n    *   **Continuous Spectra:** Produced by energy changes in many different atoms, resulting in a continuous band of colors.\n\n### The Nucleus: Composition and Notation\n*   The nucleus is composed of positively charged **protons** and uncharged **neutrons**, collectively known as **nucleons**.\n*   **Relative Charges:**\n    *   Proton: +1\n    *   Neutron: 0 (uncharged)\n    *   Electron: -1\n*   **Relative Masses (relative to electron mass = 1):**\n    *   Proton: $\\approx 1836$\n    *   Neutron: $\\approx 1839$\n    *   Electron: $1$\n*   **Proton Number (Atomic Number, Z):**\n    *   The number of protons in the nucleus.\n    *   Uniquely identifies an element and determines its chemical properties.\n    *   In a neutral atom, $Z$ also equals the number of electrons.\n*   **Nucleon Number (Mass Number, A):**\n    *   The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.\n*   **Number of Neutrons:** Calculated as $A - Z$.\n*   **Nuclide Notation:** An atom X is represented as $^{A}_{Z}\\text{X}$, where $A$ is the nucleon number and $Z$ is the proton number.\n*   **Charge on a Nucleus:** Equal to the product of the proton number $Z$ and the charge of a single proton.\n*   **Mass of a Nucleus:** Approximately equal to the product of the nucleon number $A$ and the mass of a single proton.\n\n### Isotopes and Nuclides\n*   **Isotopes:** Atoms of the same element (i.e., same proton number, $Z$) but with different numbers of neutrons (and therefore different nucleon numbers, $A$). They exhibit identical chemical properties.\n*   **Nuclide:** Refers to a specific type of atomic nucleus characterized by a unique combination of protons and neutrons.\n*   **Radioisotopes (Radionuclides):** Isotopes with unstable nuclei that undergo radioactive decay.\n\n### Nuclear Energy: Fission and Fusion\n*   **Mass-Energy Equivalence:** Energy ($E$) and mass ($m$) are interconvertible according to Einstein's famous equation: $E = mc^2$, where $c$ is the speed of light ($3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$).\n*   **Mass Defect:** A decrease in mass observed during nuclear reactions, which is converted into a substantial amount of energy. This energy often appears as the kinetic energy of the reaction products.\n*   **Nuclear Fission:**\n    *   **Process:** A heavy, unstable nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei (fission fragments), typically after absorbing a neutron. This process releases energy and additional neutrons.\n    *   **Example Reaction:** $^{235}_{92}\\text{U} + ^{1}_{0}\\text{n} \\rightarrow ^{144}_{56}\\text{Ba} + ^{90}_{36}\\text{Kr} + 2^{1}_{0}\\text{n} + \\text{energy}$.\n    *   **Conservation Laws:** The total nucleon number ($A$) and total proton number ($Z$) are conserved before and after the reaction.\n    *   **Chain Reaction:** The neutrons released during fission can induce further fission reactions in nearby nuclei, potentially leading to a self-sustaining chain reaction if a \"critical mass\" of fissile material is present.\n    *   **Nuclear Reactor:** A device that controls a nuclear fission chain reaction to produce heat (e.g., for power generation). Key components include:\n        *   **Control rods:** (e.g., boron) absorb neutrons to regulate the reaction rate.\n        *   **Moderator:** (e.g., graphite) slows down fast fission neutrons, making them more likely to cause further fission.\n        *   **Coolant:** (e.g., carbon dioxide gas) transfers heat generated by the fission reaction.\n        *   **Heat exchanger:** Uses the heat to produce steam for turbines.\n*   **Nuclear Fusion:**\n    *   **Process:** Two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.\n    *   **Conditions:** Requires extremely high temperatures (over 100 million $^\\circ$C) and pressures to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei, allowing them to fuse.\n    *   **Thermonuclear Fusion:** A self-sustaining fusion reaction where the energy released is sufficient to maintain the high temperatures required for the reaction to continue.\n    *   **Example:** The Sun's energy is produced by nuclear fusion (e.g., the \"hydrogen burning\" sequence).\n    *   **Example Reaction (Deuterium-Tritium):** $^{2}_{1}\\text{H} + ^{3}_{1}\\text{H} \\rightarrow ^{4}_{2}\\text{He} + ^{1}_{0}\\text{n} + \\text{energy}$.",
