A positively charged rod is brought close to the first sphere without touching it while the second sphere is grounded. Draw the charges on the spheres. After the grounding is removed, draw the charges on the spheres. Finally, the positively charged rod is also removed. Draw the resulting charges on the sphere.",
          "answer": "The side of the first sphere close to the positively charged rod has a negative charge and the other side has a positive charge. The side of the second sphere close to the positive side of the first sphere develops a negative charge and the other side of the second sphere, which is grounded, has no charge",
