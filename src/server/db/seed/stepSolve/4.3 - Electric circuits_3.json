The circuit consists of a light-dependent resistor (LDR) and a fixed resistor connected in series to a $!$12\\,V$!$ battery. When there is sufficient sunlight, the resistance of the LDR decreases to $!$100\\,\\Omega$!$, and the fixed resistor has a resistance of $!$200\\,\\Omega$!$. The output voltage $!$V_{LDR}$!$ is taken across the LDR. Calculate $!$V_{LDR}$!$.",
