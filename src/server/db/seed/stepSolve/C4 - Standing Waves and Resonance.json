Assume that without any damping, the amplitude of oscillation would increase linearly with time when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency. However, the bridge's engineers have installed a damping system that provides a damping force proportional to the bridge's velocity. Given that it takes $!$10\\,\\text{minutes}$!$ for the amplitude to reach a dangerous level when the wind gusts have a frequency of $!$0.5\\,\\text{Hz}$!$, and the damping system reduces the amplitude growth rate by $!$60\\%$!$, determine how long it would take for the bridge's oscillations to reach the same dangerous level if the frequency of the wind gusts were $!$0.6\\,\\text{Hz}$!$ and the damping system reduces the amplitude growth rate by $!$50\\%$!$. Assume the amplitude increases linearly with time.",
