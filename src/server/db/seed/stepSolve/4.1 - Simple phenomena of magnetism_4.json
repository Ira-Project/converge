Suppose that when the fishing rod's magnet (with a magnetic dipole moment of $!$\\mu_r = 1.2\\times10^3\\,A\\cdot m^2$!$) is held at a distance of $!$d = 0.25\\,m$!$ from a fish with a steel paper clip, the induced magnetic dipole in the paper clip has a moment of $!$\\mu_f = 3.5\\times10^{-2}\\,A\\cdot m^2$!$. Assuming that the interaction between the two magnetic dipoles is governed by the formula for the force between aligned dipoles along their axis, calculate the magnitude of the attractive force (in Newtons) between the fishing rod's magnet and the paper clip. Use the dipole-dipole force formula: $!$F = \\frac{3\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\frac{\\mu_r \\mu_f}{d^4}$!$, where $!$\\mu_0 = 4\\pi\\times10^{-7}\\,N/A^2$!$. Provide your answer as a single numerical value.",
