The inner sphere has a radius of 10 cm and the outer sphere has a radius of 11 cm. The thermos contains 0.5 kg of coffee, initially at a temperature of $!$90\\degree C$!$. Assuming the outer surface of the thermos is at room temperature ($!$20\\degree C$!$) and the emissivity of the reflective coating is 0.05, determine how long it will take for the coffee to cool down to $!$85\\degree C$!$, applying Stefan-Boltzmann's Law and using a specific heat capacity of coffee of $!$4200\\,J/kg\\cdot K$!$.",
