    "chapter_text": "### Fundamental Wave Concepts\n*   Waves are disturbances that transfer energy from one point to another without transferring matter.\n*   **Mechanical waves** are produced by a disturbance (e.g., vibrating object) in a material medium, with particles vibrating about a fixed position. Examples include waves on a rope or spring, water waves, and sound waves.\n*   A **progressive wave** or **travelling wave** is a disturbance that carries energy from one place to another without transferring matter.\n\n### Types of Waves\n*   **Transverse waves**: The direction of the disturbance (vibration) is at right angles (perpendicular) to the direction of propagation (wave travel).\n    *   Examples: Waves on a rope, water waves, seismic S-waves, electromagnetic radiations.\n*   **Longitudinal waves**: The direction of the disturbance (vibration) is along the same line as (parallel to) the direction of propagation (wave travel).\n    *   Characterized by **compressions** (regions where particles are closer together) and **rarefactions** (regions where particles are further apart).\n    *   Examples: Sound waves, seismic P-waves.\n\n### Key Wave Properties\n*   **Wavelength ($\\lambda$)**: The distance between successive corresponding points on a wave, such as two consecutive crests or troughs, in a displacement-distance graph.\n*   **Frequency ($f$)**: The number of complete waves generated per second. The unit of frequency is the Hertz (Hz). The frequency of a wave is equal to the frequency of its source.\n*   **Wave speed ($v$)**: The distance traveled by a crest (or any point) on the wave in one second in the direction of wave travel.\n*   **Amplitude ($a$)**: The maximum displacement of a particle from its undisturbed (equilibrium) position, measured as the height of a crest or the depth of a trough.\n*   **Phase**: Describes the relative positions of different points on a wave. Points with the same speed and direction of vibration are said to be **in phase**. Points with opposite directions of vibration are **out of phase**.\n\n### Wave Equation\n*   The relationship between wave speed ($v$), frequency ($f$), and wavelength ($\\lambda$) is given by the wave equation:\n    *   $v = f\\lambda$\n\n### Wave Phenomena\n*   **Wavefronts**: Lines or surfaces on which all points of a disturbance have the same phase (e.g., the crests of water waves).\n*   **Rays**: Lines drawn at right angles to wavefronts, indicating the direction of wave travel.\n*   **Reflection**: The bouncing back of a wave when it strikes a surface.\n    *   The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.\n*   **Refraction**: The change in direction of a wave when it passes from one medium to another, caused by a change in its speed and wavelength.\n    *   When waves move from a deeper to a shallower medium, their speed decreases, and their wavelength shortens, causing them to bend towards the normal.\n    *   The frequency of the wave remains unchanged during refraction.\n*   **Diffraction**: The spreading out of waves as they pass through a gap or around the edge of an obstacle.\n    *   **Effect of gap size**:\n        *   **Narrow gap** (width approximately equal to wavelength): Waves spread out significantly, forming circular wavefronts after passing through.\n        *   **Wide gap** (width much larger than wavelength): Waves continue mostly straight, with only slight spreading at the edges.\n    *   **Effect of wavelength**: Diffraction is more noticeable for longer wavelengths (relative to the obstacle or gap size).\n\n### Advanced Wave Concepts\n*   **Huygens' Construction**: A method used to determine the future position of a wavefront by considering every point on the current wavefront as a source of secondary spherical wavelets. The new wavefront is the tangent to these wavelets. This principle helps explain reflection, refraction, and diffraction.\n*   **Interference (Superposition)**: The combination of two or more waves.\n    *   When crests meet crests (or troughs meet troughs), they are **in phase**, resulting in constructive interference (a larger amplitude).\n    *   When a crest meets a trough, they are **out of phase**, resulting in destructive interference (cancellation if amplitudes are equal, leading to an undisturbed region).\n*   **Polarisation**: A phenomenon that occurs only with transverse waves, where the vibrations of the wave are confined to a single plane.",
