    "chapter_text": "**5.2.1 Detection of Radioactivity**\n*   **Background Radiation:** Continuous exposure from both natural sources (e.g., radon gas in air/buildings, cosmic rays, food/drink containing Potassium-40) and artificial sources (e.g., medical procedures, nuclear power stations, nuclear bomb fallout).\n*   **Detection Principle:** Radiation's ability to ionise (knock electrons out of) air molecules, creating ions.\n*   **Detection Devices:**\n    *   **Electroscope:** Discharges when near an ionising source due to neutralisation of its charge.\n    *   **Geiger-M\u00fcller (GM) Tube:** Detects radiation by its ionising effect within a gas-filled tube, producing electrical pulses.\n        *   **Scaler:** Counts the total number of pulses received over a specific time.\n        *   **Ratemeter:** Displays the count-rate directly (e.g., counts per second or minute), often with an audible 'click'.\n*   **Count-rate Correction:** Measured count-rates from a source must be corrected by subtracting the background count-rate (measured away from the source).\n    *   Corrected count-rate = Measured count-rate - Background count-rate.\n\n**5.2.2 The Three Types of Nuclear Emission**\n*   **Radioactive Decay:** A spontaneous and random process where unstable nuclei emit radiation to become more stable, transforming into a different element.\n*   **Types of Radiation and Properties:**\n    *   **Alpha ($\\alpha$) Particles:**\n        *   Nature: Doubly positively charged helium nuclei ($_2^4\\text{He}$).\n        *   Penetrating Power: Least penetrating; stopped by thick paper or a few centimetres of air.\n        *   Ionising Power: Highest, due to large mass and double positive charge, causing frequent collisions.\n        *   Deflection: Deflected by electric and strong magnetic fields (consistent with positive charge).\n    *   **Beta ($\\beta$) Particles:**\n        *   Nature: High-energy electrons (most commonly $\\beta^-$ particles, $_{-1}^0\\text{e}$).\n        *   Penetrating Power: More penetrating than $\\alpha$; stopped by a few millimetres of aluminium or several metres of air.\n        *   Ionising Power: Much less than $\\alpha$, due to single negative charge.\n        *   Deflection: More easily deflected than $\\alpha$ by electric and magnetic fields (consistent with negative charge).\n    *   **Gamma ($\\gamma$) Radiation:**\n        *   Nature: High-frequency electromagnetic waves (like very short X-rays), carrying no charge or significant mass.\n        *   Penetrating Power: Most penetrating; requires many centimetres of lead for absorption.\n        *   Ionising Power: Least ionising, but still sufficient to knock electrons from atoms.\n        *   Deflection: Not deflected by electric or magnetic fields.\n*   **Detection Capabilities:** GM tubes detect $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ and energetic $\\alpha$; charged electroscopes detect only $\\alpha$. All three types cause fluorescence.\n*   **Particle Tracks:**\n    *   **Cloud Chambers:** Visualize radiation paths as condensation trails formed by ionisation (e.g., $\\alpha$ produces thick, straight tracks; $\\beta$ produces thinner, sometimes twisted tracks).\n    *   **Bubble Chambers:** Offer clearer tracks in liquid hydrogen; a magnetic field can curve charged particle paths to determine their charge sign.\n\n**5.2.3 Radioactive Decay**\n*   **Nature of Decay:** Spontaneous and random, independent of external conditions like temperature or chemical combination.\n*   **Nuclear Stability:** Determined by the neutron-to-proton ratio (N/Z). Unstable nuclei decay to achieve a more stable configuration closer to the \"stability line\".\n*   **Decay Types and Nuclide Notation:**\n    *   **Alpha ($\\alpha$) Decay:** Decreases nucleon number (A) by 4 and proton number (Z) by 2, making heavy nuclei lighter and more stable.\n        *   Equation: $ \\ce{_Z^A X -> _{Z-2}^{A-4} Y + _2^4 He} $\n    *   **Beta ($\\beta^-$) Decay:** A neutron converts to a proton and an electron. Nucleon number (A) remains constant, proton number (Z) increases by 1. Increases stability for neutron-rich nuclei.\n        *   Equation: $ \\ce{_Z^A X -> _{Z+1}^A Y + _{-1}^0 e} $\n    *   **Gamma ($\\gamma$) Emission:** Occurs when an excited nucleus (following $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ decay) rearranges, releasing energy as electromagnetic waves without changing A or Z.\n    *   **Positron ($\\beta^+$) Emission:** A proton converts to a neutron and a positron ($_{+1}^0\\text{e}$). Decreases Z by 1. Occurs for proton-rich nuclei.\n        *   Equation: $ \\ce{_Z^A X -> _{Z-1}^A Y + _{+1}^0 e} $\n    *   **Neutrinos and Antineutrinos:** Emitted during $\\beta^+$ and $\\beta^-$ decay respectively.\n\n**5.2.4 Half-life**\n*   **Definition:** The time required for half the nuclei of a given radioactive isotope in a sample to decay.\n*   **Activity:** The rate of decay (average number of disintegrations per second) of a sample.\n*   **Decay Curve:** A plot of activity against time, illustrating the exponential decrease where activity halves every half-life.\n*   **Calculation:** Half-life can be determined from experimental decay data or decay curves, after correcting for background radiation.\n*   **Variability:** Half-lives vary enormously, from microseconds to billions of years, depending on the isotope.\n\n**5.2.5 Uses of Radioactivity**\n*   **Smoke Alarms:** Utilize $\\alpha$-particles (from Americium-241) to ionise air. Smoke reduces ion flow, triggering the alarm. $\\alpha$-particles are chosen for their short range and the source for its long half-life.\n*   **Sterilisation:** $\\gamma$-radiation is used to kill bacteria on medical instruments and food. Chosen for high penetrating power and long half-life.\n*   **Thickness Gauges:** Radioisotopes ( $\\beta$ for thin materials, $\\gamma$ for thick) monitor material thickness by measuring radiation absorption. Long half-life sources are preferred for constant activity.\n*   **Flaw Detection:** Detects internal flaws in materials by measuring variations in radiation transmission.\n*   **Medical Applications:**\n    *   **Diagnosis:** $\\gamma$-emitting radioisotopes (short half-life to limit exposure) are used as tracers for imaging and detecting conditions like tumours.\n    *   **Radiotherapy:** High-energy $\\gamma$-beams are focused on tumours to destroy cancerous cells. Long half-life isotopes may be used for external treatment.\n*   **Tracers:** Weak radioisotopes (with half-lives matching experiment duration) are used to track processes in medicine, agriculture, and industry.\n*   **Archaeology (Radiocarbon Dating):** Uses the known half-life of Carbon-14 (5700 years) to estimate the age of organic remains by measuring its residual radioactivity.\n\n**5.2.6 Safety Precautions**\n*   **Dangers:** Ionising radiation causes cell and tissue damage, leading to burns, cataracts, cancers, and genetic mutations. $\\alpha$-emitters are particularly hazardous if ingested or inhaled.\n*   **Safety Principles (Time, Distance, Shielding):**\n    *   **Time:** Minimise exposure duration.\n    *   **Distance:** Maximise distance from the source (radiation intensity decreases with distance).\n    *   **Shielding:** Use appropriate absorbing materials (e.g., lead, concrete) to block radiation.\n*   **Handling and Storage:** Radioactive materials should be handled with forceps, kept away from eyes, and stored in their protective containers when not in use. Industrial sources are handled remotely and transported in thick lead containers. Workers use dose badges to monitor exposure.\n*   **Waste Disposal:** Low-level waste is typically buried in steel containers; high-level waste is immobilized and stored deep underground.",
