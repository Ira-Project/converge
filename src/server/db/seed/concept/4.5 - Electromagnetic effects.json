    "chapter_text": "### Electromagnetic Induction\n\n*   **Definition:** An electromotive force (e.m.f.) is induced in a conductor when it moves across a magnetic field or when a changing magnetic field links with the conductor.\n*   **Discovery:** First observed by Faraday in 1831, leading to the development of electrical generators.\n*   **Conditions for Induction:**\n    *   Relative motion between the conductor and the magnetic field.\n    *   The conductor must cut magnetic field lines (not move parallel to them).\n*   **Factors Affecting the Magnitude of Induced e.m.f.:** The induced e.m.f. increases with:\n    *   The speed of relative motion between the conductor and the magnetic field lines.\n    *   The number of turns on the coil (if a coil is used).\n    *   The strength of the magnet/magnetic field.\n*   **Direction of Induced e.m.f. (Lenz's Law):** The direction of the induced e.m.f. (and resulting current) is always such as to oppose the change (motion or flux change) causing it, in accordance with the principle of conservation of energy.\n*   **Fleming's Right-Hand Rule (Dynamo Rule):** Used to determine the relative directions of motion, magnetic field, and induced current for a straight conductor:\n    *   **Thumb:** Direction of Motion (or Force on conductor).\n    *   **First Finger:** Direction of Field.\n    *   **Second Finger:** Direction of Induced Current.\n\n### Magnetic Effect of a Current\n\n*   **Discovery:** Hans Oersted (1819) discovered that an electric current produces a magnetic field around it.\n*   **Magnetic Field Patterns:**\n    *   **Straight Wire:** Concentric circles around the wire, with the field strength decreasing with distance from the wire.\n    *   **Circular Coil:** Field lines are straight and perpendicular to the plane of the coil at its center.\n    *   **Solenoid:** Produces a magnetic field pattern similar to that of a bar magnet, with distinct North and South poles. The field is strongest inside the solenoid.\n*   **Rules for Determining Field Direction:**\n    *   **Right-Hand Screw Rule:** If a right-handed screw moves forward in the direction of the (conventional) current, the direction of rotation of the screw gives the direction of the magnetic field lines.\n    *   **Right-Hand Grip Rule (for Solenoid):** If the fingers of the right hand grip the solenoid in the direction of the (conventional) current, the thumb points to the North pole.\n*   **Factors Affecting Magnetic Field Strength:**\n    *   **Straight Wire:** Increases with current, decreases with distance.\n    *   **Solenoid:** Increases with the number of turns, the current, and the presence of a soft iron core.\n*   **Applications:**\n    *   **Relay:** An electromagnet acts as a switch, allowing a low-power circuit to control a high-power circuit.\n    *   **Reed Switch:** Magnetic reeds in a glass tube close a circuit when magnetized by a current or external magnet.\n    *   **Loudspeaker:** Varying audio current in a coil interacts with a permanent magnet's field, causing the coil (and attached cone) to vibrate and produce sound waves.\n    *   **Electric Bell:** An electromagnet intermittently attracts an armature, causing a hammer to strike a gong and simultaneously break/remake the circuit for continuous ringing.\n\n### Force on a Current-Carrying Conductor (Motor Effect)\n\n*   **Principle:** A current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force, provided it is not parallel to the field lines.\n*   **Factors Affecting the Force:** The force increases with:\n    *   The strength of the magnetic field.\n    *   The magnitude of the current.\n    *   The length of the conductor in the field.\n*   **Fleming's Left-Hand Rule (Motor Rule):** Used to determine the relative directions of force, magnetic field, and current for a conductor experiencing a force:\n    *   **Thumb:** Direction of Thrust (Force).\n    *   **First Finger:** Direction of Field.\n    *   **Second Finger:** Direction of Current.\n*   **Force on Charged Particles:** Beams of charged particles (e.g., electrons) moving through a magnetic field also experience a force, which can cause them to follow a circular path if moving perpendicular to the field. The direction of force is given by Fleming's Left-Hand Rule (using conventional current direction).\n\n### A.C. Generator (Alternator)\n\n*   **Principle:** When a coil rotates in a magnetic field, its sides continuously cut magnetic field lines, inducing an e.m.f.\n*   **Construction:** A simple a.c. generator consists of a rectangular coil rotating between the poles of a magnet, with its ends connected to slip rings and carbon brushes.\n*   **Action:**\n    *   e.m.f. is zero when the coil sides move parallel to the field lines (vertical position).\n    *   e.m.f. is maximum when the coil sides move perpendicular to the field lines (horizontal position).\n    *   The direction of the induced e.m.f. (and current) reverses every half rotation, producing alternating current (a.c.).\n*   **Frequency:** The number of complete cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz).\n*   **Practical Generators:** In power stations, large generators use rotating electromagnets (rotor) and stationary coils (stator) to induce high e.m.f. and currents efficiently.\n\n### D.C. Motor\n\n*   **Principle (Turning Effect):** A current-carrying coil in a magnetic field experiences forces on its sides, creating a turning effect (torque).\n*   **Factors Affecting Turning Effect:** The turning effect increases with:\n    *   The number of turns on the coil.\n    *   The current flowing in the coil.\n    *   The strength of the magnetic field.\n*   **Construction:** A simple d.c. motor consists of a rectangular coil rotating between magnet poles, connected to a split-ring commutator and carbon brushes.\n*   **Action:**\n    *   Forces on the coil sides (due to Fleming's Left-Hand Rule) produce a turning effect.\n    *   The split-ring commutator reverses the direction of current in the coil every half rotation, ensuring the turning effect is always in the same direction, leading to continuous rotation.\n*   **Practical Motors:** Utilize armatures (coils wound on soft iron cores), multiple coils, and electromagnets for increased power and smoother operation.\n\n### Transformer\n\n*   **Principle (Mutual Induction):** A changing current in a primary coil creates a changing magnetic field, which induces an alternating voltage and current in a nearby secondary coil.\n*   **Construction:** Consists of a primary coil and a secondary coil wound on a common soft iron core (either stacked or on separate limbs).\n*   **Transformer Equation (for ideal transformer):** Relates voltages and turns ratios:\n    \\[ \\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \\frac{N_p}{N_s} \\]\n    where \\(V_p\\) is primary voltage, \\(V_s\\) is secondary voltage, \\(N_p\\) is number of primary turns, and \\(N_s\\) is number of secondary turns.\n*   **Types:**\n    *   **Step-up Transformer:** Has more turns on the secondary coil ($N_s > N_p$), so it increases voltage ($V_s > V_p$).\n    *   **Step-down Transformer:** Has fewer turns on the secondary coil ($N_s < N_p$), so it decreases voltage ($V_s < V_p$).\n*   **Energy Losses in Real Transformers:**\n    *   **Resistance of Windings:** Heat loss ($P = I^2R$) due to resistance of copper wires.\n    *   **Eddy Currents:** Induced currents within the iron core cause heating. Minimized by using a laminated (layered and insulated) core.\n    *   **Leakage of Field Lines:** Not all magnetic field lines from the primary coil link with the secondary coil. Minimized by good core design.\n*   **Ideal Transformer Efficiency:** Assumed 100% efficient, meaning power in primary equals power in secondary:\n    \\[ I_p V_p = I_s V_s \\]\n    where \\(I_p\\) is primary current and \\(I_s\\) is secondary current.\n*   **High-Voltage Transmission (National Grid):**\n    *   Electricity is generated at lower voltages (e.g., 25 kV), then stepped up to very high voltages (e.g., 275 kV or 400 kV) for long-distance transmission.\n    *   **Advantages:**\n        *   **Reduced Power Loss:** Power loss in transmission cables is given by \\(P_{\\text{loss}} = I^2R\\). By stepping up voltage, the current \\(I\\) is drastically reduced for the same transmitted power (\\(P_{\\text{transmitted}} = IV\\)), thus significantly reducing \\(I^2R\\) heat losses.\n        *   **Thinner Cables:** Lower currents mean thinner, cheaper cables can be used, which are easier to handle.\n    *   Voltages are then stepped down by substation transformers for local distribution.\n*   **Applications of Eddy Currents:**\n    *   **Car Speedometer:** A rotating magnet induces eddy currents in an aluminum disc, causing it to rotate against a spring, indicating speed.\n    *   **Metal Detector:** A primary coil's alternating magnetic field induces eddy currents in hidden metal objects, which in turn induce a current in a secondary coil, signaling the presence of metal.",
