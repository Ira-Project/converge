The particle travels undeflected through the region, implying that the magnetic force exactly cancels the electric force. After establishing this condition, the electric field is suddenly switched off. Using the fact that the particle initially moves at the exact speed needed for force cancellation, calculate the radius $!$R$!$ of the circular path the alpha particle now follows due solely to the magnetic field.",
