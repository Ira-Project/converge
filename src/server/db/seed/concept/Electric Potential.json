  "chapter_text": "Here's a concise summary of the concepts covered in the document, organized into sections:\n\n**Electricity Basics**\n\n*   Electricity is the movement of charges.\n*   Transferring electricity requires energy.\n*   Electrical energy is often measured in kWh (for homes) or MWh (megawatt hours) for larger amounts.\n*   Electricity in physics refers to electrical energy and the movement of charges.\n*   Electricity is transferred through transmission lines (conducting wires).\n*   The movement of electrons is electricity.\n\n**Electric Potential**\n\n*   Electric potential is the amount of electrical potential energy associated with charges (electrons).\n*   Electric potential difference is the change in electrical potential energy associated with charges at two different points.\n*   The unit for electric potential is the joule per coulomb (J/C), which is known as the volt (V).\n*   A positive electric potential difference is often called a voltage gain, while a negative electric potential difference is called a voltage drop.\n\n**Electric Potential Difference Formula**\n*  The electric potential difference can be calculated as:\n    $V = \\frac{\\Delta E}{Q}$\n\n**Electrical Power**\n\n*   Electrical power (P) is the rate at which electrical energy is generated or transformed.\n*   The formula for electrical power:\n    $P = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta t}$\n\n**Measuring Electric Potential Difference**\n\n*   A voltmeter is used to measure electric potential difference.\n*   Sources increase electric potential (voltage gain), and loads decrease electric potential (voltage drop).",
