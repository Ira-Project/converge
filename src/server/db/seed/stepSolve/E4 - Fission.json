The initial rate of fission energy production is $!$200 MW$!$, and it is increasing at a rate of $!$20 MW/s$!$. Assuming the heat exchanger's removal rate remains constant, calculate how many seconds the operators have before the rate of fission energy production exceeds the heat removal capacity by $!$50%$!$ of the heat exchanger's maximum capacity, potentially leading to a nuclear accident.",
