Before the collision, the astronaut is stationary relative to the ISS, and the debris is moving at a velocity of $!$v_D = 8\\,\\text{m/s}$!$ towards her. Upon impact, the debris becomes embedded in the astronaut's suit. Assuming that the collision is completely inelastic, meaning the debris and the astronaut move together as one mass after the collision, determine the final velocity $!$v_f$!$ of the astronaut-debris system immediately after the impact.",
