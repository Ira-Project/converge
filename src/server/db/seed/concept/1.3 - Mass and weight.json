    "chapter_text": "**Mass**\n*   Mass is a measure of the quantity of matter in an object at rest relative to an observer.\n*   The standard unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).\n*   The gram (g) is one-thousandth of a kilogram: $1\\text{ g} = \\frac{1}{1000}\\text{ kg} = 10^{-3}\\text{ kg} = 0.001\\text{ kg}$.\n*   Mass is distinct from weight and remains constant regardless of location.\n*   Mass is measured using balances (e.g., beam balance, lever balance, digital top-pan balance).\n\n**Weight**\n*   Weight is a gravitational force on an object that has mass, experienced as the pull of gravity.\n*   It is a vector quantity and is measured in newtons (N).\n*   Weight is measured using a spring balance.\n*   The weight of an object of mass $m$ is calculated by the formula: $W = mg$, where $g$ is the gravitational field strength.\n*   On most of Earth's surface, an object of mass 1 kg has a weight of approximately 9.8 N (often taken as 10 N).\n*   Weight varies depending on the strength of the gravitational field (e.g., less on the Moon than Earth), and slightly on Earth's surface (greater at the poles than the equator).\n\n**Gravitational Field**\n*   A gravitational field is the region around a mass (like Earth) that exerts a gravitational force on other objects within it. It is an invisible, action-at-a-distance force.\n*   Gravitational field strength ($g$) is defined as the force acting per unit mass.\n*   The formula for gravitational field strength is: $g = \\frac{W}{m}$.\n*   Gravitational field strength is a vector quantity, possessing both magnitude and direction.\n*   The value of $g$ is equivalent to the acceleration of free fall.\n*   On Earth's surface, $g \\approx 9.8\\text{ N/kg}$ or $9.8\\text{ m/s}^2$ (often approximated as 10 N/kg).\n*   The weight of an object is directly proportional to its mass, explaining why the acceleration due to gravity ($g$) is the same for all objects (due to greater inertia offsetting greater force for more massive objects).",
