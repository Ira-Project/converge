The crane exerts an upward tension force, $!$T$!$, through a cable. As the beam ascends, it experiences its weight, $!$W$!$, due to gravity and a drag force, $!$F_d$!$, from the wind opposing its motion. The drag force is proportional to the square of the beam's velocity, given by $!$F_d = bv^2$!$, where $!$b = 2.0 kg/m$!$.\n\nAt a certain height, the crane operator adjusts the tension such that the beam moves upwards at a constant velocity. Calculate the tension $!$T$!$ in the cable when the beam reaches a constant velocity of $!$5 m/s$!$. (Assume $!$g = 9.8 m/s^2$!$)",
