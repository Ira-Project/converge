    "chapter_text": "**Introduction to Forces & Effects**\n*   A force is defined as a push or a pull.\n*   Forces can alter an object's speed, direction of travel, shape, or size.\n*   Multiple forces acting on an object can be combined into a single **resultant force**, which describes their combined effect.\n*   **Friction** and **drag** (including **air resistance**) are forces that oppose motion and convert kinetic energy into thermal energy.\n\n**Springs and Hooke's Law**\n*   The extension of a spring is directly proportional to the stretching force applied to it, provided the **limit of proportionality** is not exceeded.\n*   The **limit of proportionality** is the point on a load-extension graph where the relationship ceases to be linear.\n*   The **spring constant** ($k$) quantifies a spring's stiffness and is defined as the force per unit extension.\n*   Formula: $F = kx$, where $F$ is the force, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the extension. This can also be expressed as $k = \\frac{F}{x}$.\n\n**Forces and Resultants (Newton's First Law)**\n*   Forces possess both magnitude (size) and direction.\n*   When forces act along the same straight line, their resultant is found by simple addition or subtraction.\n*   For forces acting at a point but not in a straight line, the **parallelogram law** can be used: if two forces are represented by the sides of a parallelogram, their resultant is represented by the diagonal drawn from the same point.\n*   **Newton's First Law of Motion**: An object will remain at rest or continue moving at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted upon by a **resultant force**.\n*   **Inertia** is the property of matter that resists changes in its state of motion; mass is a measure of inertia.\n*   An object is in **equilibrium** when the forces acting on it balance, resulting in no resultant force and no change in its motion.\n\n**Newton's Second Law of Motion**\n*   The acceleration ($a$) of an object is directly proportional to the resultant force ($F$) applied to it and inversely proportional to its mass ($m$).\n*   Formula: $F = ma$, where $F$ is the resultant force in Newtons (N), $m$ is the mass in kilograms (kg), and $a$ is the acceleration in metres per second squared (m/s$^2$).\n*   One Newton (N) is defined as the force required to give a mass of 1 kg an acceleration of 1 m/s$^2$.\n*   The acceleration produced is always in the same direction as the resultant force.\n\n**Friction**\n*   **Friction** is a force that opposes the motion, or attempted motion, between two surfaces in contact.\n*   It causes kinetic energy to be converted into thermal energy (heat).\n*   **Static friction** is the maximum frictional force before motion begins.\n*   **Sliding (dynamic) friction** is the frictional force during motion, typically less than static friction.\n*   **Drag** and **air resistance** are forms of friction experienced by objects moving through fluids (gases or liquids).\n\n**Newton's Third Law of Motion**\n*   **Newton's Third Law of Motion**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means forces always occur in pairs, acting on *different* objects.\n\n**Circular Motion & Centripetal Force**\n*   An object in circular motion is continuously changing direction, and therefore its velocity is changing, indicating it is accelerating.\n*   **Centripetal force** (centre-seeking force) is the force that acts towards the centre of the circular path, maintaining the object's circular motion.\n*   A larger centripetal force is required to maintain circular motion if:\n    *   The speed ($v$) of the object increases (mass and radius constant).\n    *   The radius ($r$) of the circle decreases (mass and speed constant).\n    *   The mass ($m$) of the object increases (speed and radius constant).\n*   If the centripetal force is removed, the object will move in a straight line tangent to the circle at the point of release.\n*   Satellites utilize centripetal force (provided by Earth's gravity) to orbit the Earth.\n\n**Turning Effect of Forces (Moments)**\n*   The **moment of a force** is its turning effect about a pivot.\n*   It depends on the force's magnitude and its perpendicular distance from the pivot.\n*   Formula: moment of a force = force $\\times$ perpendicular distance from the pivot.\n*   The unit of moment is the Newton metre (Nm).\n*   A **lever** is a device that turns about a pivot (fulcrum), using an effort force to overcome a load force.\n\n**Principle of Moments & Equilibrium**\n*   **Principle of Moments (Law of Moments)**: When an object is in equilibrium, the sum of all clockwise moments about any pivot point is equal to the sum of all anticlockwise moments about the same point.\n*   Conditions for an object to be in **equilibrium**:\n    *   The sum of forces in one direction equals the sum of forces in the opposite direction (no resultant force).\n    *   There is no resultant moment (the principle of moments applies).\n\n**Centre of Gravity**\n*   The **centre of gravity (CG)**, also known as the centre of mass, is the single point where an object's entire weight can be considered to act.\n*   For a symmetrical object with uniform density, the CG is at its geometric centre.\n*   When an object is suspended freely and comes to rest, its centre of gravity will lie vertically below the point of suspension.\n\n**Stability & Toppling**\n*   An object **topples** when the vertical line passing through its centre of gravity falls outside its base of support.\n*   The **stability** of an object is increased by:\n    *   Lowering its centre of gravity.\n    *   Increasing the area of its base.\n*   Types of equilibrium:\n    *   **Stable equilibrium**: The object returns to its original position after a slight displacement (its CG rises).\n    *   **Unstable equilibrium**: The object moves further away from its original position after a slight displacement (its CG falls).\n    *   **Neutral equilibrium**: The object remains in its new position after a displacement (its CG neither rises nor falls).",
