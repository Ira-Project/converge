    "chapter_text": "### 4.2.1 Electric Charge\n\n*   **Types of Charge**: There are two types of electrostatic charge: positive (+) and negative (-).\n*   **Interaction of Charges**:\n    *   Like charges repel (e.g., positive repels positive, negative repels negative).\n    *   Opposite charges attract (e.g., positive attracts negative).\n*   **Charging by Friction**: Electrostatic charges arise when electrons are transferred between objects by rubbing. It is only electrons which move; protons remain fixed.\n    *   An object that loses electrons becomes positively charged.\n    *   An object that gains electrons becomes negatively charged.\n*   **Conductors and Insulators**:\n    *   **Conductors**: Materials where some electrons are free to move from atom to atom (e.g., metals, carbon, water, human body, Earth). Charge flows away to neutralise.\n    *   **Insulators**: Materials where all electrons are bound firmly to their atoms (e.g., plastics, dry air, wood, paper, cotton). Charge remains static.\n*   **Unit of Charge**: Charge is measured in coulombs (C).\n    *   The charge on an electron $e = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}$ C.\n*   **Electric Field**: The region of space where an electric charge experiences a force due to other charges.\n    *   It exerts an action-at-a-distance force.\n    *   **Direction of an Electric Field**: The direction of the force on a small positive charge placed in the field. (Negative charges experience a force in the opposite direction.)\n    *   It is a vector quantity (has both magnitude and direction).\n    *   **Field Patterns**:\n        *   **Uniform Electric Field**: Produced between two oppositely charged parallel metal plates, represented by evenly spaced parallel lines perpendicular to the surfaces.\n        *   **Point Charge/Charged Sphere**: Field lines radiate outwards for positive charges and inwards for negative charges, emerging at right angles to a conducting surface.\n\n### 4.2.2 Electric Current\n\n*   **Definition**: An electric current consists of moving electric charges.\n*   **Electrical Conduction in Metals**: Occurs due to the drift of free electrons from the negative to the positive terminal of a power source.\n*   **Electric Current Equation**: The charge passing a point per unit time.\n    *   $I = \\frac{Q}{t}$ (where $I$ is current in amperes (A), $Q$ is charge in coulombs (C), and $t$ is time in seconds (s)).\n*   **Unit of Current**: Ampere (A).\n*   **Unit of Charge (redefined)**: One coulomb (C) is the charge passing any point in a circuit when a steady current of 1 ampere flows for 1 second. Therefore, $1 \\text{ C} = 1 \\text{ As}$.\n*   **Effects of Current**: Heating, magnetic, and chemical effects.\n*   **Measurement**: An ammeter is used to measure current and must be placed in series in a circuit.\n*   **Conventional Current vs. Electron Flow**:\n    *   **Conventional Current**: Flows from positive to negative terminals (historical agreement).\n    *   **Electron Flow**: Flows from negative to positive terminals (actual direction of electron movement).\n*   **Types of Current**:\n    *   **Direct Current (d.c.)**: Electrons flow in one direction only (can be steady or varying). Produced by batteries.\n    *   **Alternating Current (a.c.)**: The direction of flow reverses regularly. Produced by generators.\n    *   **Frequency of a.c.**: The number of complete alternations or cycles in 1 second, measured in hertz (Hz).\n\n### 4.2.3 Electromotive Force and Potential Difference\n\n*   **Electromotive Force (e.m.f.)**: The electrical work done by a source in moving a unit charge around a complete circuit.\n    *   $E = \\frac{W}{Q}$ (where $E$ is e.m.f. in volts (V), $W$ is electrical work/energy transferred in joules (J), and $Q$ is charge in coulombs (C)).\n*   **Potential Difference (p.d.)**: The work done by a unit charge passing through a component in a circuit.\n    *   $V = \\frac{W}{Q}$ (where $V$ is p.d. in volts (V), $W$ is work/energy transferred in joules (J), and $Q$ is charge in coulombs (C)).\n*   **Unit of e.m.f. and p.d.** : Volt (V). $1 \\text{ V} = 1 \\text{ J/C}$.\n*   **Energy Transferred**:\n    *   $W = Q \\times E$ (for source)\n    *   $W = Q \\times V$ (for component)\n    *   If current $I$ flows for time $t$, then $Q = I \\times t$, so $W = I \\times t \\times V$.\n*   **Measurement**: A voltmeter is used to measure p.d. and must be placed in parallel with the component across which the p.d. is to be measured.\n\n### 4.2.4 Resistance\n\n*   **Definition**: The opposition of a conductor to current flow.\n*   **Unit**: Ohm ($\\Omega$).\n*   **Ohm's Law**: The current in a metallic conductor is directly proportional to the p.d. across its ends if the temperature and other conditions are constant.\n    *   **Resistance Equation**: $R = \\frac{V}{I}$ (where $R$ is resistance in ohms ($\\Omega$), $V$ is p.d. in volts (V), and $I$ is current in amperes (A)).\n    *   Derived forms: $V = IR$ and $I = \\frac{V}{R}$.\n    *   One ohm is the resistance of a conductor in which the current is 1 ampere when a voltage of 1 volt is applied across it ($1 \\Omega = 1 \\text{ V/A}$).\n*   **Factors Affecting Resistance of a Metallic Wire**:\n    *   Directly proportional to its length ($R \\propto l$).\n    *   Inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area ($R \\propto \\frac{1}{A}$).\n    *   Depends on the material (resistivity).\n*   **I-V Graphs**:\n    *   **Ohmic (Linear) Conductors**: Metals (at constant temperature) show a straight line through the origin, indicating constant resistance.\n    *   **Non-Ohmic Conductors**:\n        *   **Filament Lamp**: Curve flattens (resistance increases as temperature rises due to higher current/voltage).\n        *   **Semiconductor Diode**: Allows current in one direction, but has very high resistance in the reverse direction.\n        *   **Thermistor**: Resistance decreases as temperature rises.\n        *   **Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR)**: Resistance decreases as light intensity increases.\n*   **Resistors**: Components designed to have specific resistance values.\n*   **Variable Resistors**:\n    *   **Rheostat**: Used to change the current in a circuit.\n    *   **Potential Divider**: Used to change the potential difference applied to a device.\n\n### 4.2.5 Electrical Working\n\n*   **Energy Transfer in Circuits**: Electrical energy is transferred from a source to circuit components, which then transfer energy to the surroundings (e.g., as light and heat).\n*   **Power Definition**: The rate at which electrical energy is transferred.\n    *   $P = \\frac{W}{t}$ (where $P$ is power in watts (W), $W$ is energy transferred in joules (J), and $t$ is time in seconds (s)).\n*   **Electrical Power Equation**:\n    *   $P = IV$ (where $I$ is current in amperes (A), and $V$ is p.d. in volts (V)).\n    *   Units: $1 \\text{ W} = 1 \\text{ A} \\times 1 \\text{ V}$.\n    *   Other forms for a resistor $R$: $P = I^2R$ and $P = \\frac{V^2}{R}$.\n*   **Electrical Energy Transferred Equation**:\n    *   $E = Pt$ (where $E$ is energy in joules (J)).\n    *   Also: $E = IVt$.\n*   **Units of Power**: Kilowatt (kW) $= 1000 \\text{ W}$, Megawatt (MW) $= 1,000,000 \\text{ W}$.\n*   **Paying for Electricity (Kilowatt-hour)**:\n    *   **Kilowatt-hour (kWh)**: The electrical energy used by a 1 kW appliance in 1 hour (often referred to as a \"unit\" of electricity).\n    *   **Conversion**: $1 \\text{ kWh} = 1000 \\text{ J/s} \\times 3600 \\text{ s} = 3,600,000 \\text{ J} = 3.6 \\text{ MJ}$.\n    *   Electricity meters measure energy consumption in kWh.",
