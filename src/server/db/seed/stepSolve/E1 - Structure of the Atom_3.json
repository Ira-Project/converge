Two prominent lines in this spectrum have wavelengths of 656 nm and 486 nm, corresponding to electron transitions between different energy levels in the hydrogen atoms. Given that the energy of a photon is defined by the equation $!$E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$!$, where $!$h$!$ is Planck's constant ($!$6.626 x 10^{-34} Js$!$) and $!$c$!$ is the speed of light ($!$3.0 x 10^8 m/s$!$), calculate the energy difference between the two energy levels corresponding to these wavelengths.
