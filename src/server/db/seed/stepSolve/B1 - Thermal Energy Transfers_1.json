The double boiler consists of a pot filled with 2.0 kg of water, which is heated on a stove, and a bowl containing the chocolate that sits above the simmering water. The water is initially at $!$20^{\\circ}C$!$ and is brought to its boiling point ($!$100^{\\circ}C$!$). Assume that all the energy transferred to the water is used to raise its temperature and eventually vaporize it. The specific heat capacity of water is $!$4186 \\; J/kg \\cdot K$!$, and the specific latent heat of vaporization of water is $!$2.26 \\times 10^6 \\; J/kg$!$. Calculate the total amount of heat energy (in Joules) that must be supplied to the water to bring it from its initial temperature to its boiling point and then completely vaporize it.",
