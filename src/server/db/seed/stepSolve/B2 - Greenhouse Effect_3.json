Suppose the concentration of $!$CH_4$!$ increases, leading to a decrease in the intensity of outgoing longwave radiation by 5 $!$W/m^2$!$. At the same time, $!$N_2O$!$ concentration changes such that it contributes to a further reduction of 3 $!$W/m^2$!$ in the outgoing radiation. The average emissivity of the atmosphere is 0.7. If the surface temperature of Earth is 288 K, by how much would the Earth's surface temperature need to change (in Kelvin) to balance this reduction in outgoing radiation, assuming the emissivity remains constant?",
