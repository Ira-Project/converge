            "questionText": "The current question asks for an explanation rather than a single numerical answer. To refine it into a question asking for a single numerical answer, we need to quantify a relevant property. For example, if we assume that the subjective 'coldness' is due to the rate of heat transfer from the skin to the countertop, we can ask: \n\n\"Given that the thermal conductivity of stainless steel is $!$k_{ss}=16~W/(m\\cdot K)$!$ and that of wood is $!$k_{wood}=0.13~W/(m\\cdot K)$!$, the contact surface area between the hand and the countertop is $!$A=0.01~m^2$!$, and the temperature difference between the hand and the countertop is $!$\\Delta T=5~K$!$, calculate the ratio of the rate of heat transfer per unit time from a human hand touched to the stainless steel countertop to that from a wooden countertop. Assume that the rate of heat transfer $!$Q$!$ can be approximated by Fourier's law in the form $!$Q=k A (\\Delta T)/d$!$. For simplicity, assume the effective thickness $!$d$!$ through which the heat is conducted is the same for both materials. Provide your answer as a single numerical ratio.\" \n\nIf any necessary values or assumptions need to be adjusted, please provide the missing details.",
