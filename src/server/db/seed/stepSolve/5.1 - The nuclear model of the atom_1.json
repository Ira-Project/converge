In the modern nuclear model, an atom has a dense, positively charged nucleus and electrons orbiting it. Consider a neutral atom that has $!$17$!$ protons and $!$18$!$ neutrons in its nucleus. If this atom then loses $!$2$!$ electrons, calculate its net electrical charge in terms of the elementary charge $!$e$!$.",
