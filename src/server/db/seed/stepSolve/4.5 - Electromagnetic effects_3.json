            "questionText": "In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, protons (charge $!$e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$!$ C) are accelerated to velocities near the speed of light. Suppose protons moving at $!$0.99c$!$ ($!$c = 3.00 \\times 10^8$!$ m/s) enter a section of the accelerator where powerful superconducting solenoids generate a uniform magnetic field. To ensure these protons follow a circular path with a radius of $!$R = 1.0$!$ km, a centripetal force is required. The magnetic field exerts this force perpendicularly to the proton's velocity. If the magnetic field strength produced by the solenoids is known to be $!$5.0$!$ Tesla ($!$T$!$) when a current of $!$1000$!$ A flows through them, calculate the current required to keep the protons on the specified circular path, assuming the magnetic field strength is directly proportional to the current. The force required to maintain circular motion is given by $!$F = \\frac{mv^2}{R}$!$, where the mass of a proton is $!$m = 1.672 \\times 10^{-27}$!$ kg.",
