When a copper wire is inserted into the gap, the ammeter reads 2 A, and when a glass rod is inserted, the ammeter reads 0.001 A. Assuming that the ammeter has negligible resistance and does not affect the voltage across the tested material, what is the ratio of the power dissipated by the copper wire to the power dissipated by the glass rod?",
