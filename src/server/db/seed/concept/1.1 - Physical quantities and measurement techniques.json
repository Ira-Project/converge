    "chapter_text": "**Introduction to Physical Quantities**\n*   Physical quantities describe space and time using numbers.\n*   Basic quantities in physics: length, mass, and time.\n*   **SI (Syst\u00e8me International d'Unit\u00e9s) system**: A decimal system of metric units.\n\n**Measurements and Errors**\n*   Measurements require a chosen standard or unit.\n*   Any single measurement has an associated error.\n*   **Reducing error**: Taking the average of several measurements or measuring multiples.\n*   **Parallax error**: Occurs when reading a scale from an angle, not directly over the mark.\n*   **Systematic error**: An error introduced by the measurement system itself (e.g., a ruler with a space before zero, or held incorrectly).\n*   **Significant figures**: The number of figures given for a measurement, indicating its accuracy.\n    *   Calculated answers should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement used.\n    *   **Rounding rules**: If the next figure is less than 5, keep the last significant figure as is; if it is 5 or greater, increase the last significant figure by 1.\n*   **Standard notation (Powers of Ten Shorthand)**: A concise way to write numbers, showing how many times a number is multiplied or divided by 10.\n    *   Example: $4000 = 4 \\times 10^3$, $0.004 = 4 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n    *   Note: $1 = 10^0$.\n    *   In standard notation, the number of significant figures is the number of digits before the power of ten.\n\n**Length**\n*   **SI unit**: metre (m).\n*   **Definition of metre**: The distance travelled by light in a vacuum during a specific time interval.\n*   **Submultiples**:\n    *   1 decimetre (dm) = $10^{-1}\\text{ m}$\n    *   1 centimetre (cm) = $10^{-2}\\text{ m}$\n    *   1 millimetre (mm) = $10^{-3}\\text{ m}$\n    *   1 micrometre ($\\mu$m) = $10^{-6}\\text{ m}$\n    *   1 nanometre (nm) = $10^{-9}\\text{ m}$\n*   **Multiples**:\n    *   1 kilometre (km) = $10^3\\text{ m}$\n    *   1 gigametre (Gm) = $10^9\\text{ m}$\n*   **Measuring devices**: Rulers, vernier calipers, micrometer screw gauges.\n\n**Area**\n*   **Definition**: The extent of a surface.\n*   **SI unit**: square metre (m\u00b2).\n*   **Conversions**: $1\\text{ cm}^2 = 10^{-4}\\text{ m}^2$.\n*   **Formulas**:\n    *   Area of a square or rectangle: $\\text{area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{breadth}$\n    *   Area of a triangle: $\\text{area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$\n    *   Area of a circle: $\\text{area} = \\pi r^2$ (where $r$ is the radius and $\\pi \\approx 22/7 \\text{ or } 3.14$)\n    *   Circumference of a circle: $\\text{circumference} = 2\\pi r$\n\n**Volume**\n*   **Definition**: The amount of space occupied.\n*   **SI unit**: cubic metre (m\u00b3).\n*   **Commonly used unit**: cubic centimetre (cm\u00b3).\n*   **Conversions**: $1\\text{ cm}^3 = 10^{-6}\\text{ m}^3$.\n*   **Equivalences**: $1\\text{ ml} = 1\\text{ cm}^3$; $1000\\text{ cm}^3 = 1\\text{ dm}^3 = 1\\text{ litre}$.\n*   **Formulas**:\n    *   Volume of a rectangular block: $\\text{volume} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{breadth} \\times \\text{height}$\n    *   Volume of a cylinder: $\\text{volume} = \\pi r^2 h$ (where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height)\n*   **Measuring liquids**: Using a measuring cylinder. Read the **meniscus** (bottom of the curve for most liquids, top for mercury) at eye level.\n\n**Time**\n*   **SI unit**: second (s).\n*   **Definition of second**: Based on a specific number of energy changes in the caesium atom.\n*   **Time-measuring devices**: Rely on constantly repeating oscillations (e.g., stopwatches, digital clocks, tickertape timers, dataloggers).\n*   **Accuracy improvement**: Measure longer time intervals (e.g., multiple oscillations for a pendulum) and calculate the average.\n*   **Choosing a timer**: Select one precise enough for the task (e.g., stopwatch for pendulum, milliseconds for speed of sound, digital clocks for very short intervals).\n\n**Advanced Measurement Tools**\n*   **Vernier calipers**: Measures lengths to a precision of about 0.01 cm by using a sliding scale that matches marks on a main scale.\n*   **Micrometer screw gauge**: Measures very small objects to a precision of about 0.001 cm. It uses a rotating drum and a shaft scale. A friction clutch ensures consistent force.\n    *   Crucially, check for and account for **zero error** before measurement.\n\n**Scalars and Vectors**\n*   **Scalar quantity**: Has magnitude (size) only.\n    *   Examples: Time, distance, speed, mass, pressure, energy, temperature.\n    *   Added by ordinary arithmetic.\n*   **Vector quantity**: Has both magnitude (size) and direction.\n    *   Examples: Force, gravitational field strength, electric field strength, weight, velocity, acceleration, momentum.\n    *   Represented by a straight line with length representing magnitude and an arrow indicating direction.\n    *   Added geometrically, considering both magnitude and direction.\n*   **Resultant of two perpendicular vectors** ($\\mathbf{F_x}$ and $\\mathbf{F_y}$):\n    *   **Magnitude**: $F = \\sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2}$\n    *   **Direction (angle $\\theta$ with $\\mathbf{F_x}$)**: $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{F_y}{F_x}$\n    *   Can also be determined **graphically** by drawing vectors to scale and finding the diagonal of the resulting rectangle.",
