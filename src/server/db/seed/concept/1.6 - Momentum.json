Fundamental Concepts of Momentum**\n*   Momentum is defined as the product of a body's mass and its velocity.\n    *   Formula: `p = mv`\n*   Momentum is a vector quantity, possessing both magnitude and direction.\n*   Units of momentum are kilogram metre per second (kgm/s) or newton second (Ns).\n*   Change in momentum is represented as `\\Delta p = \\Delta(mv)`.\n\n**II. Conservation of Momentum**\n*   The Principle of Conservation of Momentum states that when two or more bodies interact (e.g., in a collision or explosion), their total momentum remains constant, provided no external forces act on the system.\n*   In collisions where bodies couple, the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after.\n*   In explosions, such as a rifle firing, the initial total momentum is zero, and the final total momentum also sums to zero, with parts moving in equal and opposite directions.\n*   This principle is applied in rocket and jet propulsion, where expelling high-momentum gas in one direction imparts equal and opposite momentum to the craft.\n\n**III. Force and Impulse**\n*   A steady force `F` acting on an object for a time `\\Delta t` causes a change in its momentum.\n    *   Relationship: `F = \\frac{m(v - u)}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{mv - mu}{\\Delta t}`\n*   Impulse is defined as the product of the force and the time for which the force acts.\n    *   Formula: `\\text{impulse} = F\\Delta t`\n*   The impulse acting on an object is equal to the change in its momentum.\n    *   Formula: `F\\Delta t = mv - mu = \\Delta(mv)`\n*   The resultant force is defined as the rate of change in momentum per unit time, serving as an alternative statement of Newton's second law.\n    *   Formula: `F = \\frac{\\Delta(mv)}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}`\n\n**IV. Practical Applications of Impulse and Collision Time**\n*   **Increasing Momentum:** Techniques like \"following through\" in sports (e.g., cricket, tennis) increase the collision time (`\\Delta t`), thereby increasing the impulse (`F\\Delta t`) and resulting in a greater change in momentum for the ball.\n*   **Decreasing Force (for a given change in momentum):**\n    *   Drawing back hands when catching a ball, using sand in long jumps, and employing crumple zones and extensible seat belts in cars all extend the collision time (`\\Delta t`).\n    *   By extending `\\Delta t`, the average force (`F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}`) required to achieve a certain change in momentum (`\\Delta p`) is reduced, thereby minimizing \"sting\" or injury.",
