The masses are given as follows: deuterium = 2.0141 amu, tritium = 3.01605 amu, helium-4 = 4.002603 amu, and a neutron = 1.008665 amu. Assuming that the mass difference is entirely converted to energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle (with 1 amu equivalent to 931.5 MeV/$!$c^2$!$), first compute the Q-value (energy released in a single reaction) in MeV. Then, using this Q-value, determine the number of fusion reactions per second required to sustain a power output of 500 MW.",
