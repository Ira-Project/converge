    "chapter_text": "### General Properties of Electromagnetic Waves\n\n*   **Definition**: Electromagnetic (EM) waves are a continuous spectrum of waves, including visible light, all originating from electrons in atoms undergoing energy changes.\n*   **Nature**: They are progressive transverse waves, consisting of oscillating electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave travel.\n*   **Speed**: All EM waves travel at the same high speed in a vacuum, approximately $3 \\times 10^8$ m/s, which is also approximately their speed in air.\n*   **Wave Properties**: They exhibit reflection, refraction, and diffraction.\n*   **Energy**: EM waves carry energy. The energy associated with an EM wave increases with its frequency.\n*   **Spectrum Order**: The EM spectrum ranges from radio waves (longest wavelength, lowest frequency, lowest energy) through microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, to gamma rays (shortest wavelength, highest frequency, highest energy).\n    *   Wavelengths are typically measured in nanometers (nm, $10^{-9}$ m) or micrometers ($\\mu$m, $10^{-6}$ m).\n\n### Wave Equation\n\n*   **Relationship**: The speed ($v$), frequency ($f$), and wavelength ($\\lambda$) of an EM wave are related by the wave equation:\n    $$v = f\\lambda$$\n*   **Implication**: Since the speed ($v$) of an EM wave in a particular medium is constant, a large frequency ($f$) corresponds to a small wavelength ($\\lambda$), and vice-versa.\n\n### Regions of the Electromagnetic Spectrum\n\n*   **Gamma Rays**\n    *   **Properties**: Most penetrating and dangerous due to highest frequency/energy.\n    *   **Source**: Radioactive matter.\n    *   **Uses**: Diagnose and treat cancer, sterilize surgical instruments and food (kill bacteria), detect flaws in metals.\n    *   **Dangers**: Cause mutation and damage to cells, leading to cancer. Machines are shielded with lead.\n*   **X-rays**\n    *   **Production**: High-speed electrons striking a metal target in an X-ray tube.\n    *   **Properties**: Shorter wavelengths than UV. Can penetrate some solid objects and affect photographic film. Absorbed by living cells.\n    *   **Source**: X-ray tube.\n    *   **Uses**: Dentistry, medicine (detect broken bones), security (luggage, body scanners), industry (inspect welded joints).\n    *   **Dangers**: Cause mutation and damage to cells, leading to cancer. Machines are shielded with lead.\n*   **Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation**\n    *   **Properties**: Shorter wavelengths than visible light.\n    *   **Source**: Mercury vapour lamps, Sun.\n    *   **Uses**: Cause suntan and vitamin production in skin, fluorescent paints/clothes (fluorescence), security marking (invisible signatures, fake note detection), water sterilization.\n    *   **Dangers**: High exposure can be harmful, causing sunburn, skin cancer, and eye damage.\n*   **Visible Light**\n    *   **Wavelengths**: Red light has the longest wavelength (approx. 0.7 $\\mu$m), violet light has the shortest (approx. 0.4 $\\mu$m).\n    *   **Colour Determination**: The frequency of light determines its colour.\n    *   **Monochromatic Light**: Light of a single colour and frequency.\n    *   **Dispersion**: Different frequencies (colours) travel at different speeds through transparent media and refract by different amounts.\n    *   **Intensity**: The amplitude of a light wave determines its intensity (brightness).\n    *   **Uses**: Vision, illumination, photography, optical instruments (microscopes, telescopes).\n*   **Infrared (IR) Radiation**\n    *   **Properties**: Detected by its heating effect on skin ('radiant heat').\n    *   **Source**: Anything hot (even non-glowing), electric fires. Hotter objects emit more IR and visible light (e.g., red hot, white hot).\n    *   **Uses**: Thermal imaging (hot spots, images in dark), weather forecasting, land use monitoring, assessing heat loss from buildings, intruder alarms, locating earthquake victims, drying paint, muscular complaints, remote controls (short-range communication), optical fibre communication (long-range data transmission).\n    *   **Dangers**: Can cause burns to skin and eye damage at high intensity.\n*   **Microwaves**\n    *   **Wavelengths**: A few centimeters.\n    *   **Source**: Microwave oven, aerials.\n    *   **Uses**: International telecommunications, direct broadcast satellite TV, mobile phone networks, radar (detection of ships, aircraft, speed traps), cooking (cause water molecules in food to vibrate vigorously).\n    *   **Dangers**: Produce heat when absorbed by water in living cells, potentially damaging/killing cells. Debate about mobile phone harm.\n*   **Radio Waves**\n    *   **Wavelengths**: Longest in the EM spectrum.\n    *   **Source**: Transmitting aerials.\n    *   **Uses**: Carry sound, pictures, and other information over long distances.\n    *   **Long, Medium, and Short Waves (2 km to 10 m)**:\n        *   **Properties**: Diffract around obstacles, reflected by the ionosphere (layers of charged particles in the upper atmosphere).\n        *   **Uses**: Long-distance radio reception.\n    *   **VHF (Very High Frequency) and UHF (Ultra High Frequency) Waves (10 m to 10 cm)**:\n        *   **Properties**: Require a clear, straight-line path to the receiver; not reflected by the ionosphere.\n        *   **Uses**: Local radio, television transmissions, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems, radio telescopes (astronomy).\n\n### Dangers of Electromagnetic Radiation (General)\n\n*   High exposure to EM radiation can cause harmful effects, ranging from burns to cell damage and cancer, depending on the frequency and intensity.\n\n### Communication Systems\n\n*   **Reliance**: Many communication systems rely on EM radiation.\n*   **Microwaves**: Used for mobile phones and wireless internet due to short aerials and ability to penetrate walls.\n*   **Radio Waves**: Weakened by walls, suitable for short-range applications like Bluetooth.\n*   **Optical Fibres**: Carry high-speed broadband internet and cable television signals using visible light and shortwave infrared. Higher frequencies allow faster data transmission.\n*   **Signal Types**: Information is transmitted as either analogue or digital signals.\n    *   **Analogue Signals**: Voltages (and currents) can vary smoothly and continuously over a certain range.\n    *   **Digital Signals**: Voltages have only two discrete values, typically 'high' (e.g., 5V) or 'low' (e.g., near 0V), transmitted as pulses.\n    *   **Advantages of Digital Signalling**:\n        *   Faster transmission rate.\n        *   Can be sent over longer distances due to accurate intermittent regeneration.\n        *   Less affected by noise.\n        *   Analogue signals can be electronically converted to digital for transmission.",
