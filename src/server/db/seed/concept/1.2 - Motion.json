It is a scalar quantity.\n    *   Formula: $v = \\frac{s}{t}$\n    *   Average speed: $\\text{average speed} = \\frac{\\text{total distance travelled}}{\\text{total time taken}}$\n*   **Velocity** is the distance travelled per unit time in a given direction. It is a vector quantity.\n    *   Formula: $\\text{velocity} = \\frac{\\text{distance moved in a given direction}}{\\text{time taken}}$\n    *   Alternatively, velocity is the change in displacement per unit time: $\\text{velocity} = \\frac{\\text{change in displacement}}{\\text{time taken}}$.\n*   **Uniform or Constant Velocity** implies steady speed in a straight line.\n*   **Displacement** is the distance moved in a stated direction, a vector quantity.\n*   Units for both speed and velocity are typically km/h or m/s.\n\n**Acceleration**\n\n*   **Acceleration** is defined as the change of velocity in unit time. It is a vector quantity.\n    *   Formula: $\\text{acceleration} = \\frac{\\text{change of velocity}}{\\text{time taken for change}} = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$\n*   Positive acceleration means velocity increases.\n*   Negative acceleration means velocity decreases and is also called **deceleration** or **retardation**.\n*   Units: m/s\u00b2.\n\n**Speed-Time Graphs**\n\n*   A plot of speed against time, used to solve motion problems.\n*   **Constant Speed:** Represented by a horizontal straight line.\n*   **Constant Acceleration:** Represented by a straight line with a positive gradient.\n*   **Constant Deceleration:** Represented by a straight line with a negative gradient.\n*   **Changing Acceleration:** Represented by a curved line, where the gradient changes over time.\n*   The **gradient** of a speed-time graph represents the **acceleration** of the object.\n*   The **area under** a speed-time graph measures the **distance travelled** by the object.\n*   An object at rest has zero speed and zero acceleration; its speed-time graph is a straight line along the horizontal axis.\n\n**Distance-Time Graphs**\n\n*   A plot of distance against time.\n*   **Constant Speed:** Represented by a straight line with a positive gradient.\n*   **At Rest:** Represented by a horizontal straight line (distance does not change).\n*   **Accelerating:** Represented by an upward curve with an increasing gradient.\n*   **Decelerating:** Represented by an upward curve with a decreasing gradient.\n*   The **gradient** of a distance-time graph represents the **speed** of the object.\n*   The speed at any instant is the gradient of the tangent to the graph at that point.\n\n**Equations for Constant Acceleration (SUVAT)**\n\nThese equations relate initial speed ($u$), final speed ($v$), acceleration ($a$), displacement ($s$), and time ($t$) for objects moving with constant acceleration in a straight line.\n\n*   First Equation: $v = u + at$\n*   Second Equation: $s = \\frac{(u+v)t}{2}$ (derived from average speed $\\text{average speed} = \\frac{u+v}{2}$ and $s = \\text{average speed} \\times t$)\n*   Third Equation: $s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$\n*   Fourth Equation: $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$\n\n**Falling Bodies and Acceleration of Free Fall**\n\n*   In a vacuum, all objects fall at the same rate, regardless of mass, due to the absence of air resistance.\n*   In air, **air resistance** (fluid friction) opposes motion and disproportionately affects lighter or larger-surface-area bodies.\n*   **Acceleration of Free Fall ($g$)**: The constant acceleration experienced by objects falling freely under the force of gravity near the Earth's surface.\n    *   Its value is approximately $9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$ (often approximated as $10 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$).\n    *   In calculations, $g$ replaces $a$. It is positive ($+g$) for falling bodies and negative ($-g$) for rising bodies (deceleration).\n*   For an object falling freely from rest, its distance-time relationship is $s = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$. A graph of $s$ vs $t$ is a curve, while $s$ vs $t^2$ is a straight line through the origin.\n\n**Projectiles**\n\n*   The vertical acceleration of a projectile (due to gravity) is independent of its horizontal motion.\n*   The horizontal and vertical components of motion can be treated separately.\n*   The range (horizontal distance travelled) of a projectile depends on the speed and angle of projection.\n*   Neglecting air resistance, the maximum range is achieved when the angle of projection is $45^\\circ$.\n\n**Air Resistance and Terminal Velocity**\n\n*   As an object falls, air resistance increases with its speed, reducing its acceleration.\n*   **Terminal Velocity** is reached when the upward air resistance force equals the downward gravitational force (weight). At this point, the resultant force is zero, and the object falls at a constant velocity.\n*   Terminal velocity depends on the object's size, shape, and weight. Dense, streamlined objects have high terminal velocities, while light objects with large surface areas (like parachutes) have low terminal velocities.\n*   Objects falling in liquids exhibit similar behavior.",
