Suppose a tuning fork vibrates at a frequency of $!$440 \\text{ Hz}$!$. A small piece of clay with a mass of $!$2 \\text{ grams}$!$ is then added to one of the prongs. This addition effectively increases the mass of the prong by $!$2 \\text{ grams}$!$. Assuming the original effective mass of the vibrating part of the tuning fork is $!$10 \\text{ grams}$!$, and that the stiffness (spring constant) of the tuning fork remains unchanged, determine the new frequency of the tuning fork after the clay is added. You may assume that the spring constant $!$k$!$ is $!$k = m (2\\pi f)^2$!$, where $!$f$!$ is the original frequency and $!$m$!$ is the original effective mass.",
