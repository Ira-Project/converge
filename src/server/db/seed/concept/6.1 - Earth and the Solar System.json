    "chapter_text": "**Earth's Motion and Seasons**\n\n*   Earth rotates on its axis approximately once every 24 hours, causing the cycle of day and night. The half of Earth facing the Sun experiences day, while the other half experiences night.\n*   This rotation also causes the apparent daily motion of the Sun across the sky from east to west. The Sun rises exactly in the east and sets exactly in the west only at the equinoxes (around March 20 and September 23). In the northern hemisphere, it rises north of east and sets north of west in summer, and south of these points in winter.\n*   The Sun's highest point above the horizon at noon (due south in the northern hemisphere) and the longest daylight hours occur around June 21 (northern hemisphere summer solstice). The lowest point and shortest daylight hours occur around December 21 (northern hemisphere winter solstice).\n*   The Earth's seasons are caused by two factors: its nearly circular orbit around the Sun (taking approximately 365 days) and the tilt of its axis (23.5\u00b0) relative to its orbital plane.\n*   When a hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it experiences longer daylight hours, receives more concentrated solar radiation, and thus has warmer weather (spring and summer). When tilted away, it has shorter days and is colder (autumn and winter).\n*   Equinoxes occur when the Earth's axis is not tilted toward or away from the Sun, resulting in equal hours of day and night in both hemispheres.\n\n**Moon's Motion and Phases**\n\n*   The Moon is a natural satellite that orbits Earth in a nearly circular path approximately once a month (orbital period $\\approx$ 27 days), influenced by Earth's gravitational attraction.\n*   The Moon also rotates on its own axis once per orbit, meaning the same side of the Moon always faces Earth.\n*   The Moon does not produce its own light but is visible from Earth due to reflected sunlight from the Sun. It lacks an atmosphere, and its gravitational field strength is about one-sixth that of Earth.\n*   As the Moon orbits Earth, the illuminated portion visible from Earth changes, leading to its phases:\n    *   **New Moon:** The Moon is between the Sun and Earth, and its unlit side faces Earth, making it invisible.\n    *   **First Quarter:** Approximately half of the Moon's surface is illuminated and visible from Earth as a waxing crescent grows.\n    *   **Full Moon:** The Moon is on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, appearing as a complete, fully illuminated circle.\n    *   **Last Quarter:** The illuminated portion wanes, eventually returning to a thin crescent before the next new moon.\n*   Similar to the Sun, the Moon appears to rise in the east and set in the west due to Earth's rotation.\n\n**Orbital Mechanics**\n\n*   The **average orbital speed** ($v$) of an object in a circular orbit is defined by the circumference of its orbit ($2\\pi r$) divided by its orbital period ($T$):\n    $$v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}$$\n    where $r$ is the average radius of the orbit and $T$ is the orbital duration.\n*   Planets orbit the Sun because the Sun's immense gravitational attraction provides the necessary centripetal force. Similarly, Earth's gravity keeps the Moon in its orbit.\n*   The strength of the Sun's gravitational field weakens with increasing distance. Consequently, planets further from the Sun experience a weaker gravitational force, resulting in lower orbital speeds and longer orbital durations.\n*   For objects with highly elliptical orbits, such as comets, their speed increases as they approach the Sun and decreases as they move further away. This phenomenon is explained by the **conservation of energy**: as an object moves closer to the Sun, its gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, and vice-versa as it moves away.\n\n**The Solar System: Composition and Origin**\n\n*   The Solar System comprises one star (the Sun), eight planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, moons, comets, and other natural satellites.\n*   All planets, dwarf planets, and comets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths, with the Sun located at one focus of the ellipse. While planetary orbits are nearly circular, cometary orbits can be highly eccentric.\n*   The **Accretion Model** proposes that the Solar System formed approximately 4500 million years ago from the gravitational collapse of a rotating cloud of hydrogen gas and dust (a nebula). As this material rotated, small particles collided and accreted (joined) to form larger bodies, eventually leading to the formation of planets within a disc around the nascent Sun. Evidence supporting this includes the age of Earth and Moon rocks and the common orbital plane and direction of planets.\n*   **Inner Planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars):** These are small, solid, rocky, and dense, with layered structures. They formed in the hotter inner regions of the Solar System where only materials with high melting points could solidify.\n*   **Outer Planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune):** These are much larger, colder, and primarily composed of gases (like hydrogen and helium), with low densities. They possess many moons and icy rings. They formed in the cooler, outer regions where lighter, more abundant elements could condense and be captured.\n*   **Dwarf Planets:** Objects that orbit the Sun, are massive enough to be spherical due to their own gravity, but have not cleared their orbital neighborhood of other debris (e.g., Pluto, Ceres).\n*   **Asteroids:** Rocky fragments, mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.\n*   **Comets:** Often called 'dirty snowballs,' they consist of dust embedded in ice. They follow highly elliptical orbits. As a comet approaches the Sun, solar radiation pressure causes dust and gas to form a bright head and a long tail that always points away from the Sun (e.g., Halley's Comet).\n*   The Sun is the only star in our Solar System and produces its own light. All other planets and moons are visible because they reflect sunlight.\n*   **Gravitational Field Strength:** The force of gravity between any two objects with mass is directly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. For a planet, the gravitational field strength at its surface depends on its mass and is nearly uniform, decreasing as the distance from the planet increases. The Sun's mass constitutes over 99% of the Solar System's total mass, exerting a dominant gravitational influence.\n\n**Light Travel Times**\n\n*   Light travels at a finite speed, meaning it takes time for light to traverse the vast distances within the Solar System (e.g., approximately 8 minutes for light to travel from the Sun to Earth).\n*   The time taken for light to travel a given distance can be calculated using the formula: $\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}$.",
