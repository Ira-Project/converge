    "chapter_text": "**Definition and Fundamental Concepts**\n*   Density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance.\n*   The SI unit for density is kilograms per cubic metre ($\\text{kg/m}^3$). Grams per cubic centimetre ($\\text{g/cm}^3$) is also a common unit; to convert from $\\text{g/cm}^3$ to $\\text{kg/m}^3$, multiply by $10^3$.\n*   The fundamental relationship for density ($\\rho$) is:\n    *   $\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}$\n    *   where $m$ is mass and $V$ is volume.\n*   This formula can be rearranged to calculate mass ($m$) or volume ($V$):\n    *   $m = V \\times \\rho$\n    *   $V = \\frac{m}{\\rho}$\n\n**Measurement of Density**\n*   **Regularly Shaped Solids:** Mass ($m$) is found using a balance, and volume ($V$) is determined by measuring its dimensions with a ruler.\n*   **Irregularly Shaped Solids:** Mass ($m$) is found using a balance. Volume ($V$) is determined by displacement methods:\n    *   **Method 1:** Immerse the object in a measuring cylinder containing liquid and calculate the volume as the difference between the initial and final liquid levels.\n    *   **Method 2:** Immerse the object in an overflow can filled with liquid (e.g., water) and collect the displaced liquid in a measuring cylinder. The volume of the collected liquid equals the object's volume.\n*   **Liquids:** Mass ($m$) is found by weighing an empty beaker, then weighing the beaker with a known volume of liquid transferred from a burette or measuring cylinder, and subtracting the mass of the empty beaker. Volume ($V$) is measured using the burette or measuring cylinder.\n*   **Gases (e.g., Air):** Mass ($m$) is found by weighing a flask full of the gas, then evacuating the flask with a vacuum pump and re-weighing it; the difference is the mass of the gas. Volume ($V$) is found by filling the flask with water and pouring the water into a measuring cylinder.\n\n**Floating and Sinking Principles**\n*   An object will **sink** in a liquid if its density is greater than the density of the liquid.\n*   An object will **float** (partly or wholly submerged) in a liquid if its density is less than the density of the liquid.\n*   For composite objects (e.g., an iron ship), their buoyancy is determined by their *average* density, which includes any enclosed low-density substances like air.\n*   When two liquids do not mix, the liquid with the **lower density** will float on top of the liquid with the **higher density**.",
