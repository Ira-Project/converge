    "chapter_text": "### Nature of Sound\n\n*   Sound waves are produced by **vibrating sources** (e.g., vocal cords, guitar strings, loudspeakers).\n*   Sound waves are **longitudinal waves**, meaning the particles of the transmitting medium vibrate back and forth along the same direction as the wave's travel.\n*   Sound requires a **medium** (solids, liquids, or gases) to travel; it cannot travel through a vacuum.\n*   Sound waves progress by local **compression** (molecules closer together) and **rarefaction** (molecules further apart) of the transmitting medium.\n*   Sound waves transfer energy.\n*   The relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength is given by: $v = f\\lambda$\n*   The **speed of sound** varies significantly between materials: it is fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases (e.g., ~340 m/s in air, ~1400 m/s in water, ~5000 m/s in concrete, ~6000 m/s in steel).\n*   In air, the speed of sound increases with temperature and decreases at high altitudes, but is unaffected by atmospheric pressure.\n\n### Properties of Sound Waves\n\n*   **Reflection**: Sound waves reflect well from hard, flat surfaces, forming an **echo**. The laws of reflection are similar to light.\n*   **Reverberation**: Occurs when echoes join the original sound, prolonging it, if the reflecting surface is less than ~15 m away.\n*   Sound also exhibits **refraction** and **diffraction**.\n*   **Limits of Audibility**: The approximate range of frequencies audible to humans is 20 Hz to 20000 Hz (the upper limit decreases with age).\n*   **Musical Notes vs. Noise**: Regular vibrations produce musical notes, while irregular vibrations cause noise.\n*   **Pitch**: Determined by the **frequency** of the sound wave. Higher frequency means higher pitch (and shorter wavelength). An octave means a frequency ratio of 2:1.\n*   **Loudness**: Determined by the **amplitude** of the sound wave. Larger amplitude means more sound energy enters the ear per second, resulting in a louder sound.\n*   **Quality (Timbre)**: Refers to how notes from different instruments sound different, even at the same pitch. It's determined by the presence and relative strength of **overtones** (harmonics), which are exact multiples of the fundamental frequency.\n\n### Measurement of Sound Speed\n\n*   **Echo Method**:\n    *   Involves timing the total time ($t$) for sound to travel to a distant reflecting surface (distance $d$) and back.\n    *   Formula: $\\text{speed of sound in air} = \\frac{2d}{t}$\n*   **Direct Method**:\n    *   Involves measuring the time ($t$) taken for a sound to travel a known distance ($d$) between two points (e.g., using microphones and a digital timer).\n    *   Formula: $\\text{speed of sound in air} = \\frac{d}{t}$\n\n### Ultrasound\n\n*   **Definition**: Sound with a frequency higher than 20 kHz (above the human hearing range).\n*   **Production/Detection**: Typically produced and detected by a vibrating quartz crystal, which can act as both transmitter and receiver, emitting narrow beams.\n*   **Applications (Ultrasound Echo Techniques)**: Exploits the partial or total reflection of ultrasound waves at boundaries where the medium's density changes.\n    *   **Non-destructive testing**: Used to detect flaws in materials.\n    *   **Sonar (Sound Navigation And Ranging)**: Used by ships to determine seabed depth or locate objects (like fish shoals) underwater. The distance ($d$) is calculated from the speed ($v$) and round-trip time ($t$): $d = \\frac{vt}{2}$\n    *   **Medical imaging**: Used in antenatal clinics to monitor fetal development and image internal organs. It is non-harmful to human tissue.\n*   **Other Uses**: Ultrasound drills for cutting hard materials (glass, steel) and ultrasonic cleaners for jewellery and other objects.\n\n### Seismic Waves\n\n*   Earthquakes produce **seismic waves**, which include longitudinal (P-waves) and transverse (S-waves).\n*   They travel through the Earth at speeds up to 13000 m/s with frequencies less than 100 Hz.\n*   Seismic waves can cause structural damage and, if originating under the sea, can generate **tsunami waves**.",
