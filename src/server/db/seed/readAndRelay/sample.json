  "readingPassage": "<h1>What is Work?</h1><p>For work to be done, a force must be exerted and there must be motion or displacement in the direction of the force. The work done by a force acting on an object is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance moved in the direction of the force. Work has only magnitude and no direction. Hence, work is a scalar quantity.</p><h2>Formula of Work</h2><p>The work done by a force is defined to be the product of the component of the force in the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of this displacement.</p><p>$!$W = F \\cdot d \\cdot \\cos(\\theta)$!$</p><p>Where W is the work done, F is the force, d is the displacement, θ is the angle between force and displacement and F cosθ is the component of force in the direction of displacement.</p><p>We understand from the work equation that if there is no displacement, there is no work done, irrespective of how large the force is.</p><h2>What is Energy?</h2><p>Energy is the ability to perform work. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, and it can only be transformed from one form to another. The unit of Energy is the same as of Work, i.e. Joules. Energy is found in many things, and thus there are different types of energy.</p><p>All forms of energy are either kinetic or potential. The energy in motion is known as Kinetic Energy, whereas Potential Energy is the energy stored in an object and is measured by the amount of work done.</p><p>All forms of energy are either kinetic or potential.

We can define power as the rate of doing work, and it is the amount of energy consumed per unit of time.</p><h2>Formula of Power</h2><p>As discussed, power is the rate of doing work. Therefore, it can be calculated by dividing work done by time. The formula for power is given below.</p>$!$P = \\frac{W}{t}$!$<p>Where, P is the power, W is the work done and t is the time taken.</p>",
